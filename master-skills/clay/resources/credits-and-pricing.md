# Credits & Pricing

## What Costs Credits

**Enrichments (variable costs):**
- Email discovery: 2-5 credits depending on provider (Hunter = 2, People Data Labs = 5)
- Mobile phone numbers: 2-25 credits (harder to obtain data)
- Company revenue, LinkedIn profiles, contact research: variable
- AI features: based on model selected and token usage

**Important points:**
- Each row processed by AI costs credits, regardless of result quality
- Auto-Update enabled triggers enrichments = credits consumed
- Duplicate enrichments (re-run or re-enable columns) = new credits
- **Failed searches also cost** — you pay for the attempt, not the result

## What's FREE

**Prospecting & List Building:**
- Prospecting doesn't cost credits — only enrichment does
- Google Maps, GitHub, CRM imports, web scraping sources = free

**Using Your Own API Keys:**
- If you have your own API key (e.g., OpenAI), connect it and use for free
- External sources (Zoominfo, Cognism, 6Sense) via HTTP/API = free
- Existing external plans with a provider = usable for free in Clay

**Internal Clay Actions:**
- Formulas (all data manipulation)
- Cleaning/formatting data
- CRM connections (on Pro Plan!)
- Emailer connections (on Pro Plan!)

## Tips to Save Credits

1. **Disable Auto-Update** when not needed
2. **Pause/delete AI columns** that aren't producing good results
3. **Check settings** before re-running enrichments
4. **Use "Lookup"** if data already exists in another Clay table or CRM
5. **Custom budgets** to control spend per run
6. **Don't delete** columns/tables while actions are running

## Rollover Policy

**Monthly plans:**
- Unused credits accumulate
- Maximum: 2× your monthly limit (e.g., 50K/month → max 100K)

**Annual plans:**
- 15% rollover of unused credits
- Condition: renew on same plan or higher
