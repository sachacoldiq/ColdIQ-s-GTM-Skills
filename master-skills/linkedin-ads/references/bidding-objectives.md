# Bidding & Objectives

## Bidding Strategies

### Manual Bidding (Recommended Default)
- Provides cost control and clear budget boundaries
- Start above LinkedIn's minimum threshold to gather data quickly
- Daily monitoring formula:
  - Previous day spent - allocated budget = adjustment indicator
  - Negative result → bid too low
  - Positive result → bid too high

### Automated Bidding
- Best for small audiences: focused ABM, retargeting
- Once benchmark data gathered, switch to manual

### Cost Per Send (Conversation/Message Ads)
- Start at $1, uses second-price auction model
- You pay just enough to outbid next highest bidder

## Objective Selection by Ad Type

| Ad Type | Best Objective | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Video | Video View or Engagement | ~10-15c/view, square format + captions |
| Document | Engagement | 6-7%+ CTR, keep ungated for reach |
| Single Image | Lead Gen, Engagement, or Website Visits | Versatile, most common |
| Thought Leader | Engagement | Sponsor high-performing organic posts |
| Event | Event Ad Format | Cannot use conversion objectives |
| Conversation | Direct messaging | Cost-per-send model |

### Objectives to AVOID
**Reach/Brand Awareness**: CPM model, charges per display regardless of interaction. Inefficient for most B2B use cases. Impressions alone don't signal intent.

## Budget Guidelines

### Minimums & Commitments
- **Minimum commitment**: 6 months for LinkedIn Ads to show pipeline impact
- **Testing budget**: ~$100 ad spend per creative before shutdown decisions
- **Retargeting**: $25-100 daily per campaign for initial testing
- **Thought Leader Ads**: $300-500/month, $100-150 per post over 7-10 days

### Budget Approval Framework
Present to stakeholders:
1. Budget needed for awareness/cold layer reach
2. Retargeting audience expansion timeline
3. Success metrics (leading: reach/engagement; lagging: conversions)
4. Realistic timeline expectations (3-6 months)

## Lead Gen Form Best Practices
- Max 2-3 custom fields for optimal conversion
- Pre-populated fields maintain high completion rates
- Most effective for event registrations and direct conversions
- Don't request "work mobile" or "work email" fields

## Landing Page Alignment
- Prioritize copy over design in hero section
- Ensure message consistency between ad and landing page
- How it works, who it's for, cost/outcomes, social proof
- Simple forms, easy meeting scheduling
- Address common objections
