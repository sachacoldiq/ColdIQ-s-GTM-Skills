# Competitive Research via LinkedIn Ads Library

## Accessing
Open [linkedin.com/ad-library/home](https://www.linkedin.com/ad-library/home) and search competitors. Filter by country, date range, and keywords.

**Limitation**: No performance metrics (CTR, conversions) available — creative and messaging research only.

## Five Research Methods

### 1. Conversation Ads Discovery
Search **"%FIRSTNAME%"** to find personalization tactics. Reveals how competitors use dynamic messaging.

### 2. Localization Campaign Identification
Filter by non-target countries to spot multilingual strategies. Non-English advertising can reduce costs by **up to 70%**.

### 3. Competitive Offers Analysis
Search offer keywords: "demo", "trial", "webinar", "ebook", "guide", "free". Benchmark what conversion mechanisms competitors prioritize.

### 4. Creative Concept Mapping
Document recurring visual patterns:
- Before/After comparisons
- UGC-style content
- Statistics/data callouts
- Illustrations vs photography
- Animations/GIFs
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Meme-style formats

Pattern recognition reveals their creative strategy focus.

### 5. Landing Page Teardowns
Click CTA buttons to access destination pages. Reverse-engineer UTM parameters still present in URLs to understand their complete funnel approach:
- Campaign naming conventions
- Source/medium tagging
- A/B test identifiers
- Funnel stage indicators

## Regular Monitoring
Set a monthly cadence to track competitor strategy shifts. Look for:
- New ad formats being tested
- Messaging pivot (features → problems → social proof)
- New offers or lead magnets
- New markets (geographies, languages)
- Seasonal campaigns
