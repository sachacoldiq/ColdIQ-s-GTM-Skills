# Creative & Copywriting Strategy

## Core Frameworks

### Problem + Solution
After reading the ad, prospects should articulate both the problem AND solution. If they can't → simplify.

### Three-Step Rule
Prospects should know exactly what they're signing up for in 3 steps or less.

### Voice of Customer (VoC) Integration
1. Watch 3-5 sales calls recommended by Head of Sales
2. Use ChatGPT to analyze transcripts → build empathy maps
3. Mine testimonials at scale (tools like testimonial.io)
4. Set Gong alerts for "love this", "so helpful"
5. Screenshot customer LinkedIn posts → use directly as ad creatives
6. Real customer words outperform any copywriter

## Creative Best Practices

### Copy
- **Simple language**: Avoid jargon (CAC, ROI, ARPU). Prospects need 20-40 exposures before full understanding
- **Sound human**: Conversational, personable, friendly. Not corporate
- **Specific numbers**: "48% more meetings" > "Double your meetings"
- **Powerful hooks**: Incentives (gift cards), resources (ad credits), knowledge (audits, consultations)
- **Lead with problems, not solutions**

### Visual
- **Non-ad-like ads**: Blend into feed, reference everyday concepts (Spotify, Netflix, memes) → can 3x CTR
- **Square images** (1200x1200) outperform rectangular
- **Moving elements**: GIFs/animations increase clicks
- **Real customer photos** > polished stock photography
- **Maximize screen real estate** for scroll-stopping

### Content Repurposing
Audit existing content before creating new:
- Podcast clips
- Webinar recordings
- Product demos
- Customer testimonials
- Internal team videos

## Refresh Cadence
- Refresh creatives every **4-6 weeks**
- Small retargeting audiences: refresh monthly
- CTR should exceed **0.45%** for Sponsored Content
- Monitor frequency: aim ~3 impressions/week/person
- Rotate between formats when engagement declines

## CTA Matching by Awareness Level

| Awareness | CTA Style | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Cold | Soft, educational | "Watch walkthrough", "Read guide", "See how" |
| Warm | Medium, value-exchange | "Get the report", "Join webinar", "See case study" |
| Hot | Direct, action | "Book a demo", "Start free trial", "Talk to sales" |

## Offer Strategy
Everything you promote is an offer. Common B2B offers:
- Sales call / demo scheduling
- Product demo access
- eBook / guide downloads
- Incentives or credits
- Free consultations / audits
- Webinar registrations

"Offers are the most underused lever in B2B ad performance." Test multiple types.

## Messaging Mistakes to Avoid
1. Over-relying on jargon and acronyms
2. Leading with features instead of problems
3. Generic advice that everyone gives
4. Corporate-speak instead of human tone
5. Overly long copy in initial touchpoints
6. No clear call-to-action
7. AI-generated content that feels inauthentic
