# Troubleshooting LinkedIn Ads

Work through systematically from top to bottom. Allow at least 2 weeks before major modifications, unless CTR < 0.1%.

## 1. Audience Targeting Issues
**Symptoms**: Low relevance, poor engagement from wrong people

**Diagnosis**:
- Check Demographics tab: are the right job titles, companies, industries being reached?
- Is Audience Expansion enabled? → **Turn OFF** unless intentionally broadening
- Are multiple personas mixed in one campaign?

**Fixes**:
- Narrow job title targeting
- Layer interest-based filters
- Refresh exclusion lists
- Segment campaigns by customer tier
- Separate 500+ employee companies from <500

## 2. Delivery Problems
**Symptoms**: Under-spending budget, ads not reaching priority accounts

**Diagnosis**:
- Review Demographics tab for spend distribution across accounts
- LinkedIn auction may favor cheaper impressions over higher-value ones

**Fixes**:
- Use bid multipliers (+50%) for priority segments
- Switch from CPM to CPC bidding
- Increase bids if consistently under-spending
- Check if audience is large enough (minimum 300 for LinkedIn)

## 3. Message Misalignment
**Symptoms**: Impressions but low engagement, people see ads but don't interact

**Diagnosis**:
- Compare ad copy against recent customer interviews
- Is messaging leading with features instead of problems?
- Does copy use industry-specific language?

**Fixes**:
- Lead with problems rather than solutions
- Use customer's own language (from sales calls, reviews)
- Test video formats for complex topics
- Simplify messaging — if prospects can't articulate the problem + solution after reading, it's too complex

## 4. Creative Fatigue
**Symptoms**: Declining CTR over time, increasing CPM

**Diagnosis**:
- CTR below **0.45%** for Sponsored Content = problem
- Check frequency — over 3 impressions/week/person = fatigue
- Same creative running for 6+ weeks?

**Fixes**:
- Refresh creative every 4-6 weeks
- Rotate between ad formats
- Test new messaging angles (not just surface-level variations)
- Use Thought Leader Ads for authentic feel

## 5. Landing Page Disconnect
**Symptoms**: Good CTR but low conversions, high bounce rate

**Diagnosis**:
- Is landing page message consistent with ad?
- Does page load quickly on mobile?
- Are form fields excessive?

**Fixes**:
- Ensure ad-to-landing-page message match
- Test mobile rendering
- Reduce form to essential fields only
- Prioritize copy over design in hero section
- Add social proof (logos, testimonials, case studies)

## 6. CTA Misalignment
**Symptoms**: Wrong actions from wrong audience segments

**Diagnosis**:
- Are you asking cold audiences to "Book a demo"?
- Are warm retargeting audiences getting soft CTAs?

**Fixes**:
- **Cold audiences**: Soft CTAs ("Watch walkthrough", "Read guide")
- **Warm audiences**: Medium CTAs ("See case study", "Join webinar")
- **Hot audiences**: Direct CTAs ("Book demo", "Start trial")
- Match CTA strength to awareness level
