# Targeting & Audiences

## ICP Definition Process
1. Research website, interview clients, listen to 3-5 demo calls recommended by Head of Sales
2. Use ChatGPT to analyze call transcripts → build empathy maps identifying top pain points
3. Analyze closed-won deals and late-stage pipeline with sales
4. Define: industries, company sizes, job titles that drive revenue
5. Validate findings with sales team before campaign launch

## Targeting Approaches

**Primary**: Job Titles + Company Sizes + Industries
**Alternative** (when audience too small): Job Function + Seniority + Skills

- Audience sizes: 10K-100K can both work. No ideal size — start targeting ideal customers, expand over time.
- Separate multiple personas into different campaigns for tailored messaging
- Check LinkedIn Campaign Manager's audience insights for potential exclusions

## Three High-Performing Audience Types

### 1. Remarketing Audience
Combine (90-day windows, extend to 180 for long sales cycles):
- Website visits
- Video views (25%, 50%, 75%, 97%)
- Ad interactions
- Company page visitors
- Lead form submissions
- Add target locations + job titles

### 2. Tier 1 & Tier 2 Accounts
- Upload account lists + target job titles + company size + locations
- Layer to reach decision-makers at priority companies

### 3. Open Opportunities
- Companies in active buying phases + relevant job titles + locations

## Exclusion Strategy (Critical)
Always exclude:
- Irrelevant industries and job functions
- Wrong seniority levels (students, interns, analysts)
- Current customers and competitors
- Internal employees
- Login/support page visitors
- Poor-fit titles
- Wrong company sizes
- Recent demo form submitters (thank-you page visitors)

Review demographics report weekly: "Are the people you're reaching aligned with your intended targeting?"

## ABM-Specific Targeting

### Company Lists vs Contact Lists
- **Company lists**: 95-100% match rate, auto-updates when decision-makers change roles
- **Contact lists**: 30-70% match rate — avoid when possible

### Employee Size Splitting
- **500+ employees**: Exclude managers (too many layers)
- **Under 500**: Include managers (direct decision-making power)

### Impression Capping
Use LinkedIn's Company Engagement feature to exclude companies receiving 500+ impressions in 7 days. Prevents large companies from dominating budget.

### Personalized ABM Ads
- Company name/logo ads achieve **5-10% CTR** vs standard 0.5-1%
- Avoid in Germany (legal concerns)
- Create separate remarketing lists for image clicks, video views (50%+), and website visits from target accounts only

### ABM Sales Alignment
- Use ad clicks, video views, impressions as sales outreach triggers
- Reps contacting accounts showing recent engagement have significantly higher success
- Coordinate ads with email, outbound calls, events, direct mail
- Start with 50-100 high-priority accounts, track progression

## Minimum Audience Sizes
- LinkedIn: 300 members
- Meta: 1,000 members
- YouTube & X: 100 members
- Build time: 7-30+ days depending on monthly traffic
