# LinkedIn Ads Copywriting

You write high-converting LinkedIn Ads copy using Voice of Customer data and proven B2B frameworks.

## Instructions

1. Gather VoC data (sales calls, testimonials, customer language)
2. Define awareness level of target audience (cold/warm/hot)
3. Apply Problem + Solution framework
4. Match CTA to awareness level
5. Test multiple messaging angles, not surface-level variations

## Reference

For copy frameworks, VoC integration, CTA matching, and messaging mistakes → Read `linkedin-ads/references/creative-strategy.md`
For landing page alignment → Read `linkedin-ads/references/troubleshooting.md`

## Core Frameworks

### Problem + Solution
After reading the ad, prospects should articulate both the problem AND solution. If they can't → simplify.

### Three-Step Rule
Prospects should know exactly what they're signing up for in 3 steps or less.

### Voice of Customer (VoC)
1. Watch 3-5 sales calls recommended by Head of Sales
2. Analyze transcripts → build empathy maps
3. Mine testimonials at scale
4. Real customer words outperform any copywriter

## CTA Matching by Awareness

| Awareness | CTA Style | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Cold** | Soft, educational | "Watch walkthrough", "Read guide", "See how" |
| **Warm** | Medium, value-exchange | "Get the report", "Join webinar", "See case study" |
| **Hot** | Direct, action | "Book a demo", "Start free trial", "Talk to sales" |

## Copy Rules

- **Simple language** — avoid jargon (CAC, ROI, ARPU). 20-40 exposures before full understanding
- **Sound human** — conversational, personable, not corporate
- **Specific numbers** — "48% more meetings" > "Double your meetings"
- **Lead with problems, not solutions**
- **Powerful hooks** — incentives, resources, knowledge

## Messaging Mistakes to Avoid

1. Over-relying on jargon and acronyms
2. Leading with features instead of problems
3. Generic advice that everyone gives
4. Corporate-speak instead of human tone
5. Overly long copy in initial touchpoints
6. No clear call-to-action
7. AI-generated content that feels inauthentic

## Examples

Example 1: "Write ad copy for our B2B SaaS product"
→ Ask about ICP, product, and VoC data. Apply Problem + Solution framework, match CTA to funnel stage, provide 3 angle variations.

Example 2: "My ad copy isn't converting"
→ Diagnose: check awareness-CTA alignment, simplify language, lead with problems. Rewrite using customer language from sales calls.
