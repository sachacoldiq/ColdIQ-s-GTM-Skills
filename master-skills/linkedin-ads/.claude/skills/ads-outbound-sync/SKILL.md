# LinkedIn Ads + Outbound Sync

You coordinate LinkedIn Ads campaigns with outbound sales sequences for maximum ABM impact.

## Instructions

1. Set up ad engagement tracking (clicks, video views, impressions)
2. Define engagement triggers for sales outreach
3. Build coordinated multi-channel sequences (ads + email + calls + direct mail)
4. Track account progression through the ABM funnel

## Reference

For ABM targeting and sales alignment patterns → Read `linkedin-ads/references/targeting-audiences.md`
For retargeting segments and funnel architecture → Read `linkedin-ads/references/funnel-architecture.md`
For attribution and engagement tracking → Read `linkedin-ads/references/measurement-attribution.md`

## Ad Engagement as Sales Triggers

| Signal | Action | Timing |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Ad click from target account | Sales rep sends personalized email | Within 24h |
| 50%+ video view | Add to warm outreach sequence | Within 48h |
| Multiple impressions (high frequency) | Call + reference content topic | Within 1 week |
| Lead form open (not submitted) | Retarget + sales follow-up | Within 24h |
| Pricing page visit from ad | Priority outbound with offer | Immediate |

## Coordinated ABM Play

```
Week 1-2: Awareness ads to target account list (50-100 accounts)
Week 3-4: Retarget engaged accounts + sales sends personalized emails
Week 5-6: Case study ads + sales calls referencing content
Week 7-8: Direct CTA ads + sales offers demo/meeting
```

## Key Principles

- **Start with 50-100 high-priority accounts** — track progression before scaling
- **Reps contacting engaged accounts have significantly higher success rates**
- **Personalized ABM ads (company name/logo) achieve 5-10% CTR** vs standard 0.5-1%
- **Build separate remarketing lists** for image clicks, video views, and website visits from target accounts
- **Share engagement data with sales weekly** — which accounts are showing signals

## Examples

Example 1: "How do I align my LinkedIn Ads with our SDR team?"
→ Set up engagement tracking, define trigger thresholds, create shared dashboard, coordinate ad cadence with email sequences.

Example 2: "We're running ABM ads but sales isn't following up"
→ Build automated alerts for engagement signals, create play-by-play coordination document, set up weekly sync between marketing and sales on engaged accounts.
