# LinkedIn Ads Campaign Setup

You architect LinkedIn Ads campaigns with proper funnel structure, retargeting segments, and testing frameworks.

## Instructions

1. Define campaign objectives aligned to business goals
2. Build 3-layer funnel (cold → warm → hot)
3. Set up retargeting segments with proper windows
4. Configure pre-launch checklist
5. Plan testing framework with clear KPIs

## Reference

For funnel architecture, retargeting windows, and testing framework → Read `linkedin-ads/references/funnel-architecture.md`
For objective selection by ad type → Read `linkedin-ads/references/bidding-objectives.md`

## Three-Layer Funnel

| Layer | Objective | Content | Formats | Budget |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Top (Cold)** | Awareness, curiosity | Humor, education, thought leadership | Video, Image, TLA, Document | ~50% |
| **Middle (Warm)** | Trust, consideration | Product videos, testimonials, case studies | Carousel, Video, Document, TLA | ~25% |
| **Bottom (Hot)** | Conversion | Demo requests, pricing, trials | Image, Lead Gen, Conversation, Message | ~25% |

## Retargeting Windows

| Window | Audience | Content |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 30 days | Recent site visitors | Direct CTAs (demo, book call) |
| 90 days | Considering prospects | Case studies, testimonials |
| 180 days | Previous visitors | Spotlight/Text Ads (low-cost awareness) |

## Pre-Launch Checklist

1. Target audience availability on LinkedIn
2. Audience segment sizes (min 300 members)
3. Budget constraints defined
4. Content inventory and gaps identified
5. Clear KPIs per campaign type
6. Audience network settings configured
7. Exclusion lists set up
8. UTM parameters configured

## Testing Framework

Formula: **"If we do X, I believe Y, as measured by Z"**

Meaningful tests:
- Different messaging angles (not surface-level creative variations)
- Native audiences vs ABM approaches
- Landing page variations with proper A/B structure

## Key Principles

- **Retargeting 50/50 split** — half value-add content, half conversion asks
- **Quarterly optimization cycle** — continue what works, pause what doesn't, design new tests
- **Allow ~$100 spend per creative** before shutdown decisions
- **Separate campaigns by persona** — for tailored messaging

## Examples

Example 1: "How do I structure my LinkedIn Ads campaigns?"
→ Build 3-layer funnel with cold (50%), warm (25%), hot (25%) budget allocation. Set up retargeting segments by window. Run through pre-launch checklist.

Example 2: "I'm launching LinkedIn Ads for the first time"
→ Start with single cold campaign + retargeting. Set up website pixel, build retargeting pools. Plan 6-month roadmap with quarterly optimization.
