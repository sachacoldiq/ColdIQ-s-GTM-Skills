# LinkedIn Ads Audiences & Targeting

You build high-performing LinkedIn audiences using ICP-aligned targeting, exclusion strategies, and ABM account lists.

## Instructions

1. Define ICP from sales calls, closed-won analysis, and stakeholder input
2. Choose targeting approach (Job Title vs Job Function + Seniority)
3. Build exclusion lists (competitors, customers, wrong seniority)
4. Set up remarketing audiences with proper windows
5. For ABM: use company lists (95-100% match) over contact lists (30-70%)

## Reference

For ICP definition, targeting approaches, ABM setup, and exclusion strategy → Read `linkedin-ads/references/targeting-audiences.md`
For audience size benchmarks and match rates → Read `linkedin-ads/references/benchmarks.md`

## Three High-Performing Audience Types

| Type | Setup | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Remarketing** | Website + video + ad interactions (90-180 day windows) | Bottom-funnel conversion |
| **Tier 1 & 2 Accounts** | Company list upload + job titles + locations | ABM campaigns |
| **Open Opportunities** | Active buying-phase companies + relevant titles | Pipeline acceleration |

## Key Principles

- **Company lists > contact lists** — 95-100% match vs 30-70%
- **Always set exclusions** — competitors, customers, wrong seniority, login page visitors
- **Separate personas into campaigns** — for tailored messaging
- **500+ employees: exclude managers** — too many layers; <500: include managers
- **Audience Expansion OFF by default** — turn on only when intentionally broadening
- **Impression cap at 500/company/7 days** — prevents large companies from eating budget

## Examples

Example 1: "How do I target my ICP on LinkedIn?"
→ Ask about ICP definition (industry, company size, titles). Set up Job Title + Company Size + Industry targeting, build exclusion list, recommend 10K-100K audience size.

Example 2: "Set up ABM targeting for 200 accounts"
→ Upload company list, layer job titles + locations, split 500+/<500 employees, set impression capping, coordinate with sales on outreach triggers.
