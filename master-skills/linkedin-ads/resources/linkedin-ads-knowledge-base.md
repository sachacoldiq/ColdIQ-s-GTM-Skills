## 2. AD FORMATS

### Single Image Ads
- **When**: Brand awareness, demand creation, lead capture
- **Best for**: Versatile, high engagement with minimal content

## 3. TARGETING & AUDIENCES

### ICP Definition Process
1. Research website, interview clients, listen to demo calls
2. Analyze closed-won deals and late-stage pipeline with sales
3. Define: industries, company sizes, job titles that drive revenue

### Targeting Approaches
- **Primary**: Job titles + Company Sizes + Industries
- **Alternative** (small audiences): Job Function + Seniority + Skills
- **Audience sizes**: 10K-100K can both perform well. No ideal size—start targeting ideal customers, expand over time.

### Three High-Performing Audience Types
1. **Remarketing**: 90-day website visits + video views + ad interactions + company page visitors + lead form submissions. Extend to 180 days for long sales cycles
2. **Tier 1 & Tier 2 Accounts**: Account lists + target job titles + company size + locations
3. **Open Opportunities**: Companies in active buying phases + relevant job titles + locations

### Exclusion Strategy
- Irrelevant industries and job functions
- Wrong seniority levels (students, interns)
- Current customers and competitors
- Internal employees
- Login/support page visitors
- Wrong company sizes
- Recent form submitters

### ABM-Specific Targeting
- **Company lists > Contact lists**: 95-100% match rate vs 30-70%
- **Employee size splitting**: Separate 500+ employees (exclude managers) vs <500 (include managers)
- **Impression capping**: Exclude companies receiving 500+ impressions/7 days
- **Personalized ads**: Company name/logo ads get 5-10% CTR vs standard 0.5-1%

### Minimum Audience Sizes
- LinkedIn: 300 members
- Meta: 1,000 members
- YouTube & X: 100 members
- Build time: 7-30+ days

## 4. BIDDING & OBJECTIVES

### Bidding Strategies

**Manual Bidding (Recommended)**
- Provides cost control and clear budget boundaries
- Start above LinkedIn minimum threshold to gather data quickly
- Daily monitoring: previous day spent - allocated budget = adjustment indicator
  - Negative = bid too low, Positive = bid too high

**Automated Bidding**
- Best for small audiences (ABM, retargeting)
- Once benchmark data gathered, switch to manual

**Cost Per Send (Conversation/Message Ads)**
- Start at $1, use second-price auction model

### Objective Selection

| Ad Type | Best Objective |
|---------|---------------|
| Video | Video View or Engagement |
| Document | Engagement (6-7%+ CTR achievable) |
| Single Image | Lead Gen, Engagement, or Website Visits |
| Thought Leader | Engagement (sponsor high-performing organic posts) |
| Event | Event Ad Format (no conversion objectives) |
| Conversation | Direct messaging (cost-per-send) |

**Avoid**: Reach/Brand Awareness objective — charges per impression regardless of interaction, inefficient for most B2B.

### Budget
- **Minimum commitment**: 6 months for LinkedIn Ads success
- **Testing**: ~$100 ad spend per creative before making shutdown decisions
- **Retargeting**: $25-100 daily per campaign for testing
- **Thought Leader Ads**: £300-500/month, £100-150 per post over 7-10 days

## 5. CREATIVE & COPYWRITING

### Core Frameworks

**Problem + Solution Framework**
- After reading, prospects should articulate both the problem AND solution
- If they can't → simplify messaging

**Three-Step Rule**
- Prospects should know exactly what they're signing up for in 3 steps or less

**Voice of Customer Integration**
- Watch 3-5 sales calls recommended by Head of Sales
- Use ChatGPT to analyze transcripts → build empathy maps
- Mine testimonials, Gong alerts for "love this" keywords
- Screenshot customer LinkedIn posts → use as ad creatives
- Real customer words outperform any copywriter

### Creative Best Practices
- **Simple language**: Avoid jargon (CAC, ROI, ARPU). Remember: 20-40 exposures before full understanding
- **Non-ad-like ads**: Blend into feed, reference everyday concepts (Spotify, Netflix, memes) → can triple CTR
- **Square images** (1200x1200) outperform rectangular
- **Moving elements**: GIFs/animations increase clicks
- **Real customer photos** > polished stock photography
- **Sound human**: Conversational, personable, friendly. Not corporate.
- **Specific numbers**: "48% more meetings" > "Double your meetings"

### Refresh Cadence
- Refresh creatives every **4-6 weeks**
- Small retargeting audiences: refresh monthly
- CTR should exceed **0.45%** for Sponsored Content
- Monitor frequency: aim ~3 impressions/week/person

### Thought Leader Ad Content
14 proven strategies:
1. Product feature announcements
2. Problem + Solution framework
3. Internal case studies (dog-fooding)
4. Customer case studies & success stories
5. Pre-event buzz generation (ABM targeting attendees)
6. Post-event recaps
7. Event promotion from speaker voices
8. Webinar promotion
9. Newsletter subscription

11. Product use case demonstrations
12. Industry-specific thought leadership
13. Practical advice backed by platform data

## 6. MEASUREMENT & ATTRIBUTION

### Core Equation
**Reach x Relevance x Engagement = Pipeline Uplift**

### Metrics by Force

**Force 1 — Reach Quality**
- Impressions filtered by target audience
- CPM within segments
- Named account penetration
- Profile views from relevant titles

**Force 2 — Relevance Signals**
- Dwell time
- Video completion rates
- Message ad open rates
- CTR, follower growth among targets

**Force 3 — Engagement Depth**
- Qualified CTR
- Cost-per-click within segments
- Landing page conversion rates
- Messaging response rates

### Business Outcome Metrics
- Pipeline attribution (deals traced to LinkedIn touchpoints)
- Influenced revenue (total opportunity value involving LinkedIn)
- Deal velocity (speed of LinkedIn-influenced deal closure)
- Customer acquisition cost impact
- Brand search uplift (direct company name search increases)
- Sales conversation quality (lead-to-conversion rates)

### Attribution Challenges
- Only 20-30% of LinkedIn-driven conversions are captured
- 90%+ impact occurs without clickthrough (invisible engagement)
- 83% impressions on mobile, 72% conversions on desktop (cross-device gap)
- 6-10 decision-makers per deal across channels

### Attribution Stack
1. **LinkedIn Insight Tag** — demographics, retargeting, conversion tracking
2. **LinkedIn Conversion API** — server-side, bypasses ad blockers
3. **CRM integration** (HubSpot, Salesforce) for revenue attribution
4. **UTM parameters** with LinkedIn dynamic UTM feature
5. **"How did you hear about us?"** field on high-intent forms
6. **Multi-touch tools** (Fibbler, etc.) for deeper insights
7. **View-through windows**: 7-60 day lookback for B2B
8. **Companies Tab** for account engagement monitoring

### Measurement Timeline
- Allow 2-4 weeks minimum for meaningful data
- Track long-term pipeline influence over 3-6 months
- Measure quarterly, not weekly (cumulative effects)
- Compare multiple data sources for complete picture

## 7. TROUBLESHOOTING

### Six Core Problem Areas

1. **Audience Targeting Issues**
   - Verify job functions, titles, seniority, company size, geography match ICP
   - Turn OFF Audience Expansion unless intentionally broadening
   - Segment campaigns by customer tier

2. **Delivery Problems**
   - Check Demographics tab for spend distribution
   - Use bid multipliers (+50%) for priority segments
   - Consider switching CPM → CPC bidding

3. **Message Misalignment**
   - Compare ad copy against recent customer interviews
   - Lead with problems, not solutions
   - Test video for complex topics

4. **Creative Fatigue**
   - CTR should exceed 0.45% for Sponsored Content
   - Refresh every 4-6 weeks
   - Rotate between formats

5. **Landing Page Disconnect**
   - Verify fast load, immediate message reinforcement
   - Test mobile rendering
   - Reduce form fields to essentials

6. **CTA Misalignment**
   - Cold: "Watch a walkthrough" (soft)
   - Warm: "Book a demo" (direct)
   - Match CTA strength to awareness level

### Allow 2 weeks minimum before major modifications (unless CTR < 0.1%)

## 8. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH (LinkedIn Ads Library)

### How to Use
1. Open linkedin.com/ad-library/home
2. Search competitors, filter by country/date/keywords

### Five Research Methods
1. **Conversation Ads**: Search "%FIRSTNAME%" to find personalization tactics
2. **Localization**: Filter by non-target countries → spot multilingual strategies (up to 70% cost reduction in non-English)
3. **Offer analysis**: Search "demo", "trial", "webinar", "ebook" to benchmark competitor offers
4. **Creative mapping**: Document patterns (Before/After, UGC, Stats, Illustrations, etc.)
5. **Landing page teardowns**: Click CTAs, reverse-engineer UTM parameters
