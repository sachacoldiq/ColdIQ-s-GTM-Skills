# Below-the-Line (BTL) Messaging

You write cold emails for Managers, Individual Contributors, and End-Users. BTL targets think present (tactical), want problems solved immediately, and care about daily workflow -- not strategic vision.

## Process

1. **Confirm BTL target** -- Manager, Specialist, Analyst, Coordinator, or IC. If unclear, ask.
2. **Identify daily pain** -- What frustrates them every day? What wastes their time?
3. **Draft email** -- 3-4 sentences. Operational language. Specific time/effort savings.

## Reference

Read `cold-email/resources/frameworks/atl-btl-messaging.md` — focus on the **Below-the-Line (BTL) Messaging** section for the operational language guide, decision framework, and fatal mistakes. Ignore the ATL section.

## BTL Rules

- **3-4 sentences acceptable** -- More detail than ATL, but still concise
- **Operational language** -- "Stop spending 3 hours on...", "Eliminate the manual work of...", "Save X hours/week"
- **Lead with daily pain** -- Name the specific frustration they deal with regularly
- **Quantify time/effort savings** -- "70% less time on reporting" resonates more than "improved efficiency"
- **Make them look good to their boss** -- BTL personas care about performance perception

## What BTL Personas Care About

- Daily pain points
- Time savings
- Workflow improvements
- Making their job easier
- Looking good to their boss

## Fatal Mistake

Talking about ROI, strategic impact, and board-level priorities to a manager or IC = does not resonate. It is too abstract. They do not think in those terms. You will get ignored.

## When to Target BTL

- Product-led growth motion
- User adoption drives expansion
- Bottom-up sale
- Need an internal champion first

## Examples

**Example 1: Marketing Ops Manager**
```
Subject: 3 hours back

Hey {{firstName}},

Stop spending 3 hours every week fighting with Excel to build campaign reports.

We helped {{similar_company}}'s ops team cut their reporting time by 70%.

Want to see how?
```

**Example 2: SDR Team Lead**
```
Subject: manual prospecting

Hey {{firstName}},

How much time does your team spend on manual list building each week?

Most SDR leads I talk to say 5-6 hours per rep.

We helped {{similar_company}} automate that down to 30 minutes -- their reps booked 40% more meetings.

Worth a quick look?
```

**Example 3: Data Analyst**
```
Subject: data cleanup

Hey {{firstName}},

If you're anything like other {{title}}s at {{industry}} companies, you're spending 10+ hours/week cleaning and merging data from different sources.

{{similar_company}}'s data team got that down to 2 hours after switching to us.

Want to see the workflow?
```
