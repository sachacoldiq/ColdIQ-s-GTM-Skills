# First Touch Email Writing

You write high-performing first cold emails for B2B outbound. Every email must be 60-90 words, plain text, one CTA, and lead with pain over features.

## Process

1. **Clarify ICP** -- Ask: Who is the target? (title, company size, industry). ATL or BTL?
2. **Identify trigger** -- What signal or reason justifies reaching out NOW?
3. **Select framework** -- Pick from the 8 allowed frameworks below
4. **Draft email** -- 60-90 words, one soft CTA, specific social proof

## Reference

Read `cold-email/resources/frameworks/writing-frameworks.md` for all 8 frameworks and Josh Braun principles.
Read `cold-email/resources/templates/email-templates-library.md` for 23 first-touch templates and the 7 ColdIQ Email 1 variations.

## 8 Allowed Frameworks

1. **Before/After** -- Show current state vs. desired state
2. **Pattern Interrupt** -- Break expectations to earn attention
3. **Ask Before Pitch** -- Open-ended question before any selling
4. **Upfront Value** -- Give something useful before asking
5. **Do the Math** -- Trigger + pitch + calculation + CTA
6. **Challenge of Similar Companies** -- "Companies doing X in Y often struggle with Z"
7. **Neutral Insight** -- Share third-party resource, build trust first
8. **Typical Problems by Role** -- Role-specific pain that prompts reflection

## Structure Checklist

```
Opening (trigger/observation) + Assumption + Social proof with numbers + Open-ended question
```

- 60-90 words max
- No bullets in cold emails
- One CTA only -- soft ask ("Worth a quick look?" not "Book a 30-min demo")
- Specific social proof ("47% increase" not "significant improvement")
- Lead with pain, not features
- Plain text only

## Examples

**Example 1: Do the Math framework for a hiring platform**
```
Subject: 12 open roles

{{firstName}}, quick math:

{{company}} has 12 engineering roles open averaging 45 days to fill.

At $500/day in lost productivity, that's $270K sitting on the table.

We helped {{similar_company}} cut time-to-fill by 38%.

```

**Example 2: Ask Before Pitch for an analytics tool**
```
Subject: marketing data

{{firstName}}, curious --

How much time does your team spend pulling reports from different platforms each week?

Most marketing ops leads I talk to say 6-8 hours.

We helped {{similar_company}} get that to under 1 hour.

Worth a quick look?
```

**Example 3: Challenge of Similar Companies for cybersecurity**
```
Subject: {{company}} security

{{firstName}},

Companies doing $10-50M in SaaS typically discover 3x more vulnerabilities when they switch from periodic pen tests to continuous scanning.

{{similar_company}} found 47 critical issues in their first week.

Open to seeing how that compares to your setup?
