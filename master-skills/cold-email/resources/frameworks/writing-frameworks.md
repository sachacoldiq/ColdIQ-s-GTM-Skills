# Email Writing Frameworks

## Core Frameworks

### Do the Maths Framework
- Trigger + pitch + calculation + CTA
- Example: "Saw [trigger]. Companies like yours typically [problem costing X]. We helped [similar company] reduce this by [%]. Worth a quick call?"

### Short-Trigger Based Outreach
- 3-4 sentences maximum
- Lead with observation, not pitch
- One clear CTA

### Challenge of Similar Companies
- Reference industry-specific pain
- Position as pattern you've seen
- "Companies doing [X revenue] in [industry] often struggle with [problem]"

### Neutral Insight Framework
- Share third-party resource (not your content)
- Build trust before pitching
- "Came across this [resource] that addresses [their problem]"

### Leader Responsibilities
- Role-specific questions that prompt reflection
- "As [title], how are you currently handling [challenge]?"

### Ask Before Pitch (Will Allred)
```
Open-ended question → Trigger/observation → How product solves → PS relevance
```

### Not Too Different Persona
```
"I work with [similar ICP], they struggle with [problem]..."
```

### Upfront Value (Jordan Crawford)
```
"Here's [value offering], hope it was helpful..."
```

### Leverage Content in Outbound (Ethan Parker)
```
"We've compiled [content] on [how it helps]. Can I send it over? PS - Relevant because [trigger]"
```

### "Why Are You Paying?" (Leif Bisping)
```
Set stage with life situation → Obvious choice → Compare to prospect's current solution
```

## Josh Braun Writing Principles

1. **Write with an eraser** — Remove every unnecessary word
2. **Be cheeky** — Personality matters, make them smile
3. **Be specific** — Credibility comes through precision
4. **Don't say "we reduce costs"** — Say "e-commerce companies doing $5k/month overpaying 10-15%"
5. **Use loss aversion** — Frame around what they're losing, not gaining

## Key Template Principles

1. **Lead with pain not features**
2. **Keep qualification simple** (deeper on calls)
3. **Personalize to person not just company**
4. **Use specific social proof numbers** ("47% increase" not "significant improvement")
5. **Soft CTAs work better** ("worth a look?" vs "book a call")
6. **Multi-channel coordination** (email + LinkedIn + ads)
7. **Humor reduces tension**
8. **Timing matters** (new role signals peak at days 14-45)
9. **Value-first before asking**
