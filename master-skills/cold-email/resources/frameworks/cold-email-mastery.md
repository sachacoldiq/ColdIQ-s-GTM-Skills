# Cold Email Mastery — 25 Lessons from 10M+ Emails

*Source: Growth Engine X — 1.5-2M emails/month for 40-50 clients*

## Email Infrastructure

**Volume per inbox:**
- 30 emails max per inbox
- Scale horizontally (more inboxes, not more volume per inbox)

**Open rate targets:**
- 40-60% = good
- <30% = deliverability problem
- Solution: new domains, warm up 3 weeks, restart

**Don't waste time:**
- If <1% reply rate → no need for seed tests or Glock apps
- Result will always be: new domains + new copy + restart

**Max 3 emails per sequence:**
- Email 1 = always best performance
- Email 2 & 3 = diminishing returns
- More than 3 = you annoy and get marked as spam

## TAM Reuse

**Golden rule:** Reuse your list every 3 months
- People don't remember your email from 20 minutes ago
- Their priorities/business change
- Calculate: how many emails/day to recycle the TAM in 3 months

## Filtering & Golden ICP

**The problem:**
- Director of Marketing at a 20-person bank ≠ Director of Marketing at a 500-person bank
- Generic filters (20-500 employees) don't work

**Solution — Golden ICP:**
Stack signals with Clay:

| Level | Signal | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Recently founded | < 2 years |
| 2 | Funded | Raised money |
| 3 | CEO first-time | Never been CEO before |

**Waterfall the signals:**
- Run the most important signal FIRST
- Conditional formulas to not enrich if signal #1 fails
- Change messaging based on how many signals are true

## Best Triggers

**2023: Recently Joined Company**
- "Hey congrats on the new role, as you're taking over..."
- Still reliable but somewhat overused now

**2024+: Social Signals (THE BEST)**
- LinkedIn posts
- Content engagement
- Posts about certain keywords

*Real example:* Offshore staffing company — the "LinkedIn post" trigger beat all other "logical" triggers (new hire, funded, international hiring, etc.)

## The 3-Email Framework

### Email 1: Introduce the Offer
```
Line 1: Why you, why now (why I'm reaching out now)
Line 2: Your offer clearly explained (short!)
Line 3: Social proof (you're not their first client)
Line 4: CTA (Would you want to chat next Thursday?)
```

### Email 2: Add Context
- Everything you had to cut from email 1
- It's threaded, they can scroll to see email 1
- Still short but more details

### Email 3: Lower the Friction
- They didn't respond twice → they're not convinced
- Free lead magnet
- Custom Loom audit
- Less demanding CTA

**Delay between emails:** 3-5 days (1 day = too short)

## Breakup Emails = STOP

**What doesn't work:**
- "You must be getting chased by an alligator..."
- Begging for a response

**What works:**
- "Am I reaching the right person?"
- "Is there someone else in the company who handles this?"
- Bonus with Clay: automatically name other people in the department

## Changing Value Props

**Between emails:**
- Email 1: Save money
- Email 2: Make money
- Email 3: Save time

**The "So What":**
- "We help you save 3 hours/month" → not enough
- "We help you save 3 hours/month so your SDRs can spend more time actually selling" → BETTER

## Using AI Correctly

**Show your work:**
- Bad: "I see you get 50,000 visitors/month"
- Good: "According to SimilarWeb, you get 50,000 visitors/month"
- If it's wrong, SimilarWeb is wrong, not you

**Client case studies:**
- Claygent can scrape their site's case studies
- "I noticed you worked with Intercom and helped them with XYZ"
- PS line: "Even if we never connect, saw the case study... really impressive, kudos"

**Don't have AI write the entire email:**
- Control the messaging for split-testing
- Use AI for ONE specific part
- The rest = static text

## Small TAM Strategy (<20,000 people)

**Omni-channel (actually):**
1. Cold email everyone
2. Cold call everyone
3. LinkedIn message everyone
4. Direct mail the rest

**NO complex threading:**
- Email day 1 → Call day 3 → DM day 5 = too much stress
- Do one channel at a time, exhaustively
- Same results, less complexity

## Performance Benchmarks

**2X Levers (metrics you can realistically double):**
- Cold email reply rate: 0.5-1.0%
- Email open rate: 20-40%
- Email click rate: 2-5%

**Signal-based benchmarks:**
- Cold outreach: 6-8% reply rate
- Signal-based: 18-22% reply rate
- Multi-signal stacked: 35-40% reply rate
