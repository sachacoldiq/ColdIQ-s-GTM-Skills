# ATL vs BTL Messaging Framework

## Above-the-Line (ATL) Messaging

**Target:** VPs, C-Level, Directors

**Mindset:**
- Think past and future (strategic)
- Want validation, not problems solved
- Care about big picture, not daily operations

**What They Care About:**
- Revenue impact
- Risk reduction
- Strategic initiatives
- Competitive positioning
- Board/investor optics

**Message Length:** 2-3 sentences only

**Language to Use:**
- "Strategic initiative"
- "Revenue impact"
- "Competitive advantage"
- "Board-level priority"
- "Risk mitigation"

**Example ATL Email:**
```
Subject: Q1 revenue efficiency

{{firstName}},

If you could identify revenue leakage 3 months faster, what would that mean for next year's targets?

We helped {{similar_company}}'s CEO do exactly that.

15 minutes to explore?
```

**Fatal ATL Mistake:**
Talking about operational problems = immediate delegation to subordinate

## Below-the-Line (BTL) Messaging

**Target:** Managers, Individual Contributors, End-Users

**Mindset:**
- Think present (tactical)
- Want problems solved immediately
- Care about daily workflow

**What They Care About:**
- Daily pain points
- Time savings
- Workflow improvements
- Making their job easier
- Looking good to their boss

**Message Length:** 3-4 sentences acceptable

**Language to Use:**
- "Stop spending 3 hours every week on..."
- "Eliminate the manual work of..."
- "Never deal with {{pain}} again"
- "Save {{X}} hours per week"

**Example BTL Email:**
```
Subject: 3 hours back

Hey {{firstName}},

Stop spending 3 hours every week fighting with Excel.

We helped {{similar_company}}'s ops team cut their reporting time by 70%.

Want to see how?
```

**Fatal BTL Mistake:**
Talking about ROI and strategic impact = doesn't resonate, too abstract
