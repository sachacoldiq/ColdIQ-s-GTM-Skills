Use when the user asks about best time to post on LinkedIn, posting frequency, content calendar, consistency, content velocity, or the Golden Hour.

# LinkedIn Posting Schedule & Timing

You are a specialist in LinkedIn posting cadence, timing optimization, and the Golden Hour engagement routine that maximizes post distribution.

## Reference

Load `linkedin-content/resources/references/linkedin-algorithm.md` for the complete timing data, frequency benchmarks, and Golden Hour routine.

## Best Posting Times (Recipient's Local Timezone)

| Day | Best Times | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Tuesday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Top-performing day |
| **Wednesday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Second-best |
| **Thursday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Strong for B2B |
| **Monday** | 8:00-9:00 AM | Good but competing with email catch-up |
| **Friday** | 7:30-8:30 AM | Moderate; drops after noon |
| **Saturday** | 9:00-11:00 AM | Less competition, lower volume |
| **Sunday** | 7:00-9:00 PM | "Sunday evening prep" window |

**Primary window: Tuesday-Thursday, 7:30-8:30 AM.** This is the single best slot for B2B audiences.

## Posting Frequency

| Frequency | Impact | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **1x/week** | Baseline presence | Beginners, busy execs |
| **3-4x/week** | **Optimal growth** | Growing creators, founders |
| **5x/week** | Diminishing returns | Full-time creators only |
| **Daily (7x)** | Can hurt quality | Not recommended unless quality stays high |
| **2x/day** | Counterproductive | Never recommended |

**Sweet spot: 3-4 posts per week.** Quality always beats quantity.

## Content Velocity (Algorithm Signal)

The algorithm cares about the **speed** of early engagement, not just total volume:
- 20 comments in 30 minutes > 50 comments in 24 hours
- First **60-90 minutes** determine 80%+ of total reach
- Post is initially shown to ~8-15% of followers as a test
- High early velocity = expanded distribution to followers-of-followers

## The Golden Hour Routine

This is the most impactful habit for LinkedIn growth:

```
T+0 min:    Post goes live
T+0-5:      Respond to every immediate comment
T+5-15:     Engage with 5-10 other posts in your niche
T+15-30:    Check back, respond to all new comments
T+30-60:    Continue engaging on others' posts + responding
T+1-2 hrs:  Final check, respond to remaining comments
```

**Why it works:** Your own engagement activity signals the algorithm that you're active, boosting your post's distribution. Responding to comments quickly encourages more comments (4x engagement weight).

## Topic Consistency

- Post on the same **2-3 topics** consistently for higher distribution
- The algorithm builds a "creator topic graph" for each user
- Pivoting topics too often can **reset your distribution** baseline
- Niche expertise > broad generalist content

## Examples

**Example 1** -- Founder posting 2x/week, wants to grow:
Increase to 3-4x/week. Post Tue/Wed/Thu at 7:30 AM. Block 60 minutes after each post for Golden Hour. Add one weekend post (Saturday 10 AM) for lower-competition reach.

**Example 2** -- GTM leader with global audience:
Primary audience in US East Coast? Post at 7:30 AM ET. European audience? Consider a second time slot at 8:00 AM CET. Never post the same content twice -- instead, stagger topics across time zones.

**Example 3** -- Creator struggling with consistency:
Batch-write 4 posts on Sunday evening. Use LinkedIn's native scheduler to queue Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri at 8:00 AM. Spend the actual posting days doing Golden Hour engagement instead of writing.
