## Engagement Weights

| Action | Weight | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Save/Bookmark** | **5x** | Strongest signal -- user wants to revisit |
| **Meaningful Comment** (>15 words) | **4x** | Deep engagement, builds relationships |
| **Share with commentary** | **3-4x** | Extends reach to new networks |
| **Short Comment** (<15 words) | **2x** | Lower quality signal |
| **Reaction (Like)** | **1x** | Baseline |
| **Click "see more"** | **0.5-1x** | Interest signal |

## Comment Strategy (Growth Hack)

Comments are the highest-ROI engagement activity on LinkedIn:

- Write **15+ words per comment** -- add insight, share experience, ask a question
- Post **10-20 meaningful comments daily** on posts in your niche
- Target people with **larger audiences** than yours (visibility hack)
- **Be early**: first 30 minutes after someone posts = top comment positioning
- Comment format: strong first sentence, line break, end with a question

### Comment Templates

**Add value:** "This resonates. We saw the same pattern at [company] -- [specific detail]. What's your take on [related angle]?"

**Share experience:** "I tried this approach last quarter. The result: [specific outcome]. The one thing I'd add is [insight]."

**Respectful challenge:** "Interesting take. I've seen the opposite in [context] -- [evidence]. Curious if you've seen exceptions?"

## Dwell Time Optimization

- Time spent reading your post **significantly affects its score**
- Long-form posts and carousels benefit from extended dwell
- Even without interaction, **10+ seconds reading = positive signal**
- Rapid scroll-past = negative signal
- Write content that rewards slow reading (stories, step-by-steps)

## LinkedIn Platform Limits

### Hard Limits (Do NOT Breach)
- **400 connection requests/month** (non-premium)
- **800 Open InMails/month** (premium)
- **~100-120 total interactions/day** (unofficial but enforced)

### Safe Daily Limits
- 15-20 DMs to existing connections
- 30-40 Open InMails
- 10-15 connection requests
- 40 "other" interactions (likes, comments, views)

### Warm-Up Protocol (New/Inactive Accounts)
- Days 1-10: max 60 interactions/day
- Manual activity only (no automation)
- Mix of views, likes, comments
- Gradual increase to full limits after warm-up

## DM Engagement Sequences

Keep DMs **short** (3-4 sentences max, never over one paragraph):

**Post Engager Follow-Up:** "Hey [name], saw you liked my post about [topic]. Is [pain_point] something you're dealing with at [company]?"

**Connection Acceptance:** "Thanks for connecting, [name]. Quick q -- what's your biggest challenge with [topic] right now?"

**Profile Viewer:** "Hey [name], noticed you checked out my profile. What caught your attention?"

## Engagement Pods Warning

- LinkedIn actively detects and **penalizes pods** since 2023-2024
- Algorithm identifies unnatural engagement patterns
- **Alternative:** build a genuine network of 10-20 peers who naturally engage
- Authentic mutual engagement is sustainable; formal pods are risky

## Examples

**Example 1** -- Creator getting likes but few comments:
Your content is "likeable" but not "commentable." End every post with a specific question (not generic). Write content that invites disagreement or personal stories. Use polls occasionally to train your audience to interact.

**Example 2** -- Founder wanting to build inbound pipeline via LinkedIn:
Engage 15-20 mins daily commenting on ICP prospects' posts. Use the profile viewer follow-up DM template. Keep under 15 DMs/day. Never pitch in the first message -- ask about their challenge first.

**Example 3** -- Account restricted after aggressive outreach:
Stop all outbound activity for 48-72 hours. Then restart with warm-up protocol: 60 interactions/day max for 10 days. Shift to organic engagement (comments) over DMs until limits reset.
