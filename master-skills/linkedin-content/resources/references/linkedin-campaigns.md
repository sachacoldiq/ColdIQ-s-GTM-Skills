# LinkedIn Campaign Frameworks

## LinkedIn Limits (2024-2026)

### Hard Limits
- 400 connection requests/month (non-premium)
- 800 Open InMails/month (premium)
- ~100-120 total interactions/day (unofficial but enforced)

### Safe Daily Limits
- 15-20 DMs to existing connections
- 30-40 Open InMails
- 10-15 connection requests
- 40 "other" interactions (likes, comments, views)

### What Counts as Interactions
- DMs, connection requests, InMails
- Profile views
- Post likes/comments
- Page likes
- Endorsements
- Joining events/groups

## LinkedIn Warm-Up Protocol

**When needed:** Inactive or new accounts

**Process:**
- Days 1-10: 60 interactions/day maximum
- Only manual activity (no automation)
- Mix of views, likes, comments
- Gradual increase to full limits after warm-up

## LinkedIn Copywriting Rules

1. **Never over one paragraph**
2. **3-4 sentences maximum**
3. **Create conversation, don't sell**
4. **Use auto-embedding resources:**
   - Loom videos (high engagement)
   - LinkedIn posts (social proof)
   - Webinar links (value offer)
   - Newsletter signups (nurture path)

## LinkedIn Campaign Sequence (Human-Like)

```
Step 1: View profile (Day 1)
         ↓
Step 2: Like a recent post (Day 1-2)
         ↓
Step 3: Send connection request (Day 2-3)
         ↓
[Wait for acceptance]
         ↓
Step 4: Send first message (4-24 hours after acceptance)
         ↓
Step 5: Follow-up if no response (Day 5-7)
```

## Scheduling Best Practices

- **Timezone:** Within prospect's working hours (9 AM - 6 PM their time)
- **Days:** Weekdays only (Mon-Thu best, Fri lower engagement)
- **Breaks:** At least one day off per week
- **Timing:** Message when they're likely online (inbox visibility)

## High-Converting LinkedIn Targets

**Tier 1 (Highest Priority):**
- LinkedIn Webinar/Event attendees
- Post engagers (filter to ICP via Clay)
- Company page followers
- Profile viewers

**Tier 2 (Good Priority):**
- Recently created group members
- Newsletter subscribers
- Content commenters

**Sales Navigator Must-Use Filter:**
- "Posted within last 30 days" = Active user
- Critical to avoid wasting connection requests on inactive profiles

## LinkedIn Message Templates

### Profile Viewer Follow-Up
```

```
Reply rate: 28-35% (vs 8-12% cold)

```

### Post Engager Follow-Up
```
