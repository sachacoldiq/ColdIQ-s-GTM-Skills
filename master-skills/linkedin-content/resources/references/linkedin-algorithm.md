# LinkedIn Algorithm & Content Performance (2024-2026)

## How the Feed Algorithm Works

LinkedIn's feed algorithm operates in 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Content Quality Filter
- Post classified as **spam**, **low-quality**, or **clear**
- AI checks for engagement bait, pod activity, and policy violations
- Clear posts enter distribution

### Phase 2: Initial Distribution (Golden Hour)
- Post shown to ~8-15% of followers
- Algorithm measures engagement velocity (speed and volume)
- First 60-90 minutes determine 80%+ of total reach

### Phase 3: Engagement Scoring
- Algorithm assigns "engagement credits" based on interaction type
- High-scoring posts enter viral distribution
- Sent to followers-of-followers and topic feeds

### Phase 4: Extended Distribution
- Top posts continue receiving impressions for 24-72 hours
- Evergreen content can resurface days or weeks later
- Saves and shares extend lifecycle significantly

## Engagement Weights (Relative Value)

| Action | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **Save/Bookmark** | ~5x | Strongest signal — user wants to revisit |
| **Meaningful Comment** (>15 words) | ~4x | Indicates deep engagement |
| **Share with commentary** | ~3-4x | Extends reach to new networks |
| **Short Comment** (<15 words) | ~2x | Engagement but lower quality |
| **Reaction (Like)** | ~1x | Baseline signal |
| **Click "see more"** | ~0.5-1x | Shows interest but lower commitment |
| **Profile click** | ~0.5x | Curiosity signal |

### Dwell Time
- Time spent reading a post significantly affects its score
- Long-form posts and carousels benefit from extended dwell
- Even without interaction, 10+ seconds reading = positive signal
- Rapid scroll-past = negative signal

### Content Velocity
- Speed of engagement matters more than total volume
- 20 comments in 30 minutes > 50 comments in 24 hours
- Algorithm front-loads distribution based on early signals

### Topic Consistency
- Posting on the same 2-3 topics consistently = higher distribution
- Algorithm builds a "creator topic graph"
- Pivoting topics too often can reset your distribution

## Content Format Performance

| Format | Reach Multiplier | Avg Engagement Rate | Best For |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Carousels (PDF)** | **2.5-3.5x** | 3-5% | Educational content, frameworks |
| **Text-Only Posts** | **1x** (baseline) | 2-3% | Stories, opinions, insights |
| **Native Video** | **1.2-2x** | 2-4% | Personal brand, tutorials |
| **Images with Text** | **1-1.5x** | 2-3% | Infographics, quotes |
| **Polls** | **0.8-1.2x** | High clicks, low depth | Audience research (use sparingly) |
| **Newsletters** | **Variable** | 30-50% open rate | Deep content, subscriber growth |
| **External Links** | **0.3-0.6x** | 1-2% | Driving off-platform traffic (penalized) |

### Carousels / Document Posts
- **Highest-performing organic format** on LinkedIn
- Optimal slide count: **8-12 slides**
- First slide acts as a "cover" — must be compelling like a headline
- Last slide should include a CTA (follow, comment, save)
- Design tips: large text (mobile-readable), consistent branding, one idea per slide

### Text-Only Posts
- Optimal length: **800-1,300 characters**
- "See more" fold at ~**210 characters on mobile** — hook must be here
- Single sentences per line with blank lines between
- Unicode characters for bullets/arrows, numbered lists

### Native Video
- Optimal length: **30-90 seconds** for feed, up to 10 min for tutorials
- Captions essential (85%+ watched on mute)
- Vertical (9:16) supported and recommended for mobile
- Talking-head + text overlay performs best

### Polls
- **Deprioritized** in 2024-2025 due to low-quality abuse
- Use sparingly (max 1/week)
- 2-3 answer options outperform 4 options

### Newsletters
- Subscribers get **push notifications + email** on publish
- Average open rates: **30-50%**
- Indexed by Google (SEO benefit)
- Recommended frequency: weekly or biweekly

### External Links
- Posts with links receive **40-60% less reach**
- Workaround: post text natively, add link in first comment
- Alternative: "link in comments" mention

## Posting Strategy

### Best Times to Post

| Day | Best Times (local timezone) | Notes |
|-----|---------------------------|-------|
| **Tuesday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Top-performing day |
| **Wednesday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Second-best |
| **Thursday** | 7:30-8:30 AM, 12:00-1:00 PM | Strong for B2B |
| **Monday** | 8:00-9:00 AM | Good but people catching up on emails |
| **Friday** | 7:30-8:30 AM | Moderate; drops after noon |
| **Saturday** | 9:00-11:00 AM | Less competition |
| **Sunday** | 7:00-9:00 PM | "Sunday evening prep" window |

### Posting Frequency

| Frequency | Impact | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **1x/week** | Baseline | Beginners, busy professionals |
| **2-3x/week** | Optimal for most | Growing creators |
| **4-5x/week** | Diminishing returns | Full-time creators |
| **Daily (7x)** | Can hurt quality | Only if quality remains high |
| **2x/day** | Counterproductive | Not recommended |

**Sweet spot: 3-4 posts/week.** Quality always beats quantity.

### The Golden Hour Routine

```
T+0 min: Post goes live
T+0-5 min: Respond to immediate comments
T+5-15 min: Engage with 5-10 others' posts in your niche
T+15-30 min: Check back, respond to every comment
T+30-60 min: Continue engaging + responding
T+1-2 hrs: Final check, respond to remaining
```

### Comment Strategy (Growth Hack)

- **15+ words per comment** — add insight, share experience, ask questions
- **10-20 meaningful comments/day** on posts in your niche
- Comment on posts from people with larger audiences
- Be early: first 30 minutes = top positioning
- Comment format: strong first sentence, line breaks, end with question

### Engagement Pods

- LinkedIn actively detects and penalizes engagement pods since 2023-2024
- Algorithm identifies unnatural engagement patterns
- **Alternative**: Build genuine network of 10-20 peers who naturally engage
- Formal pods are increasingly risky; authentic mutual engagement is sustainable

## LinkedIn Creator Tools

- Requires third-party tool (StreamYard, Restream, OBS)
- Promote 24-48 hours before + 1 hour before
