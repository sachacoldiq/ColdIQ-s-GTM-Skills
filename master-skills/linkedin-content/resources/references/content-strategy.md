# LinkedIn Content Strategy: Hooks, Frameworks & Profile Optimization

## Hook Writing Techniques

The hook is text visible before the "see more" fold — ~210 characters on mobile (2-3 lines). This is the most important element of any LinkedIn post.

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Template | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Specific Result** | "I [action] [timeframe]. Here's [result]." | "I cold-emailed 500 CEOs in 30 days. 47 replied." |
| **Myth Buster** | "[Common belief] is wrong. Here's why." | "Posting every day on LinkedIn is wrong. Here's why." |
| **Listicle Tease** | "[Number] [things] that [outcome]. #[X] is underrated." | "7 LinkedIn hacks that 10x'd my reach. #4 is underrated." |
| **Before/After** | "Last year: [bad state]. Today: [good state]. The difference?" | "Last year: 50 followers. Today: 50,000. The difference?" |
| **Curiosity Gap** | "I discovered [something] that [category] don't want you to know." | "I discovered why most LinkedIn advice is designed to fail." |
| **Social Proof** | "[Authority/Number] taught me [lesson]." | "After working with 200+ founders, I noticed one pattern." |
| **Direct Address** | "If you're [situation], read this." | "If you're posting on LinkedIn with zero engagement, read this." |
| **Controversial Take** | "[Strong opinion]. And I'll die on this hill." | "Networking events are a waste of time. And I'll die on this hill." |

### First Line Strategies

**1. Bold Contrarian Statement**
- "Cold outreach is dead. Here's what replaced it."
- "Your LinkedIn headline is costing you clients."

**2. Specific Number + Unexpected Outcome**
- "I analyzed 1,000 LinkedIn posts. Only 3% went viral. Here's what they had in common."
- "147 sales calls. 0 deals. Then I changed one thing."

**3. Personal Confession / Vulnerability**
- "I got fired 6 months ago. Best thing that ever happened to me."
- "My biggest career mistake cost me $200K."

**4. Question That Reframes**
- "What if everything you know about hiring is wrong?"
- "Why do 90% of startups fail while copying successful ones?"

**5. Pattern Interrupt**
- Start with a single word: "Stop." / "Wait." / "Unpopular opinion:"
- Lead with emotion that contrasts professional tone: "I cried in a board meeting."

### Curiosity Gap Techniques

- **Withhold the key detail**: "One change to my morning routine made everything click."
- **Imply a secret**: "Most people don't know this about LinkedIn's algorithm."
- **Unexpected juxtaposition**: "A rejection email led to my best client."
- **Promise a reveal**: "I'll share the exact framework at the end of this post."
- **Numbered incompleteness**: "There are 3 types of LinkedIn posts. Most people only know 2."

### Hook Don'ts

- Do NOT start with "I'm excited to announce..." (generic, low engagement)
- Do NOT start with a question answerable with "no" (people scroll past)
- Do NOT use clickbait the post doesn't deliver on
- Do NOT start with hashtags or mentions
- Do NOT bury the hook after a preamble

## Storytelling Frameworks for LinkedIn

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)

```
[ATTENTION] I lost my biggest client last Tuesday.

[INTEREST] They represented 40% of our revenue. The email was two sentences.
"We're going in a different direction. Thanks for everything."

[DESIRE] That night, I rewrote our entire onboarding process. I added
monthly check-ins, quarterly reviews, and a client health score.
Within 3 weeks, our retention rate went from 72% to 94%.

[ACTION] If you're not measuring client health, you're waiting for
the breakup email. Save this post for the framework I used.
```

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

```
[PROBLEM] You're posting on LinkedIn 5x a week and getting 12 likes.

[AGITATE] Meanwhile, people with half your expertise are getting 10K views
per post. They're landing clients in DMs. Speaking gigs.
Podcast invites. It's not your content. It's your format.

[SOLUTION] I switched from text-only to carousels 6 months ago.
Same ideas. Same audience. 5x the reach. Here's the
exact template I use:
```

### BAB (Before - After - Bridge)

```
BEFORE: I spent 3 hours writing LinkedIn posts. Got 200 views.
Felt like shouting into the void.

AFTER: I spend 30 minutes per post. Average 15K views.
Get 2-3 inbound leads per week.

THE BRIDGE: I created a content system with 3 parts:
1. Hook library (50 proven first lines)
2. Framework templates (fill in the blank structures)
3. Engagement ritual (15 min post-publish routine)
```

### Additional Frameworks

**"One Thing" Framework:**
Hook → Brief context → Single key insight → Evidence/proof → Takeaway → CTA

**"Mistake > Lesson" Framework:**
Hook ("I made a costly mistake...") → What happened → What it cost → What you learned → Why you're grateful → CTA

**"Listicle with Depth" Framework:**
Hook ("[X] things I learned...") → Items with 1-2 line explanations → Last item most surprising → CTA

**"Contrarian Take" Framework:**
Hook ("[Popular belief] is wrong.") → Acknowledge → Evidence → Reframe → Nuance → CTA

### Storytelling Rules

1. **Specificity beats generality**: "$47,312 in Q3" > "a lot of money"
2. **One post = one idea**: Never cover multiple topics
3. **6th-grade reading level**: Short sentences. Simple words.
4. **Use dialogue**: "My boss said: 'You're not ready.' I said: 'Watch me.'"
5. **End with the reader**: Transform "what I learned" into "what you can do"
6. **Vulnerability is not weakness**: Sharing failures builds trust
7. **Tension drives reading**: Create tension early, resolve late

## Profile Optimization

### Headline Formulas (220 characters max)

**Formula 1**: "I help [audience] [achieve result]"
- "I help B2B SaaS companies generate pipeline through cold outreach"

**Formula 2**: "Role | Niche Authority + Proof"
- "Head of Growth @ Acme | Helped 3 startups reach $10M ARR"

**Formula 3**: "[Role] | [What you do] | [Social proof/CTA]"
- "Fractional CMO | Revenue-focused marketing for B2B | Former HubSpot"

**Formula 4**: "Niche Keyword + Differentiator"
- "The only LinkedIn strategist who guarantees results"

**Best Practices:**
- Lead with what you do for others, not job title alone
- Include relevant keywords for LinkedIn search
- Avoid buzzwords: "visionary," "guru," "ninja," "thought leader"
- Use pipe "|" or bullet "·" to separate phrases

### About Section Framework (2,600 chars max)

```
[HOOK - First 2 lines visible before "see more"]
Compelling statement about who you help and what makes you different.

[THE PROBLEM YOU SOLVE - 2-3 sentences]
Paint the pain your audience feels.

[YOUR APPROACH - 3-5 sentences]
How you solve the problem. Your unique methodology.

[PROOF - 3-5 bullet points]
- Specific results achieved
- Notable clients or companies
- Relevant certifications
- Media features or speaking

[WHO I WORK WITH - 2-3 sentences]
Describe ideal client clearly so they self-identify.

[CTA - 1-2 sentences]
Exact next step. DM? Book a call? Email?
Email: your@email.com
```

### Featured Section (Top of Profile)

**Priority order:**
1. Lead magnet / free resource (drives email list)
2. Best-performing LinkedIn post (social proof)
3. Case study / testimonial (proof of results)
4. Newsletter (subscriber growth)
5. Media appearance (authority)

Tips: Max 3-5 items, custom thumbnails, most important = leftmost, update monthly.

### Banner Design
- Dimensions: **1584 x 396 pixels** (4:1 ratio)
- Keep critical text in center (edges cropped on mobile)
- Communicate: who you are, what you do, value prop
- Include: tagline, website URL, key offering, or social proof

### Social Proof Elements

1. **Recommendations**: 5-10+ from clients/colleagues with specific prompts
2. **Skills endorsements**: Pin top 3 relevant skills, aim for 99+
3. **Activity section**: Consistent, high-quality posting = trust
4. **Experience descriptions**: Include metrics ("Grew team from 5 to 25, +340% revenue")
5. **Follower count**: >5,000 signals authority
6. **Custom URL**: Claim linkedin.com/in/yourname

## Key Takeaways

1. **Saves are the new likes** — create content worth bookmarking
2. **Carousels dominate** — invest in 8-12 slide educational carousels
3. **First 90 minutes matter most** — be present and engaged after posting
4. **Hook in 210 characters** — first line determines if anyone reads the rest
5. **3-4 posts/week** — sweet spot for growth without burnout
6. **Comments are a growth channel** — 15+ meaningful comments daily
7. **Newsletters compound** — every subscriber = guaranteed notification
8. **Niche > broad** — algorithm rewards topic consistency
9. **Vulnerability + insight = engagement** — failures + professional lesson
10. **Profile = landing page** — optimize as conversion funnel
