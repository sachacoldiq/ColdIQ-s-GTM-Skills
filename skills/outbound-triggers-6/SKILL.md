# OUTBOUND Premises (6 Triggers)

## 1. CXO Passdown

**Strategy:** Start at the top, get passed down to the right person

**Execution:**
- Email C-level executive
- Ask for direction to right person
- Creates internal referral

**Template:**
```
{{firstName}},

I'm not sure if this lands on your desk or someone else's.

We help [ICP] with [problem].

Who should I be talking to about [topic] at {{company}}?
```

---

## 2. To "Groundswell" for Info

**Strategy:** Build internal champions before approaching decision maker

**Execution:**
- Target end-users and ICs
- Provide value and resources
- Build grassroots support

---

## 3. To "Groundswell" for Product-Placement

**Strategy:** Get product in hands of end-users first

**Execution:**
- Free trials to ICs
- Bottom-up adoption
- Let usage drive demand

---

## 4. To DM Based on "Groundswell" Product-Placement

**Strategy:** Use internal adoption as proof point for decision maker

**Execution:**
- Reference internal usage
- Show adoption metrics
- Convert to paid/enterprise

**Template:**
```
{{firstName}},

{{number}} people at {{company}} are already using [product].

[Names/teams] have been active for [timeframe].

Worth discussing how to scale this across the org?
```

---

## 5. Multi-Persona (Cross-Departmental)

**Strategy:** Coordinate outreach across multiple stakeholders

**Execution:**
- Map buying committee
- Tailor message per role
- Coordinate timing

**Roles to target:**
- Economic buyer (budget)
- Technical buyer (evaluation)
- End user (adoption)
- Champion (internal advocate)

---

## 6. Typical "Cold Outbound"

**Strategy:** Pure cold outreach with no prior signal

**Execution:**
- 1:1 personalization required
- Pattern-interrupt opening
- Heavy research investment

**Messaging Approach:**
```
First Line: Core-Static Relevance (Lean on Pattern Interruptive Opener)
Second Line: Core-Static Relevance ("We work with...")
```

## Outbound Success Factors

1. **Deep research** - Know the person and company
2. **Pattern interrupt** - Stand out from generic emails
3. **Clear relevance** - Why you, why now
4. **Multi-channel** - Don't rely on email alone
5. **Persistence** - Multiple touches required
