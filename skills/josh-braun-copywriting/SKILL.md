# Josh Braun Writing Principles

## The 5 Principles

1. **Write with an eraser** - Remove every unnecessary word
2. **Be cheeky** - Personality matters, make them smile
3. **Be specific** - Credibility comes through precision
4. **Don't say "we reduce costs"** - Say "e-commerce companies doing $5k/month overpaying 10-15%"
5. **Use loss aversion** - Frame around what they're losing, not gaining

---

## Personalization Best Practices

### DO:
- Custom prompts based on research
- Facts prospects consistently care about
- Time business was founded (owners proud of longevity)
- Recent company news/changes
- Tech stack signals

### DON'T:
- Generic AI compliments ("Love your work!")
- Content that sounds same as what they already have
- Over-personalization that feels creepy
- Complimenting LinkedIn posts without substance

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Specificity = Credibility**: "47% increase" beats "significant improvement"
- **Loss > Gain**: People act more to avoid loss than to gain
- **Every word must earn its place**: If it doesn't add value, delete it
- **Personality differentiates**: Be human, not corporate
