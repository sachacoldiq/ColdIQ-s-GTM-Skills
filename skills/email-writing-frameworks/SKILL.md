# Email Writing Frameworks

## 1. Do the Maths Framework

Trigger + pitch + calculation + CTA

**Structure:**
```
Saw [trigger]. Companies like yours typically [problem costing X].
We helped [similar company] reduce this by [%].
Worth a quick call?
```

**When to use:** When you can quantify the problem or ROI

---

## 2. Short-Trigger Based Outreach

**Rules:**
- 3-4 sentences maximum
- Lead with observation, not pitch
- One clear CTA

**Structure:**
```
[Observation about their situation]
[Brief connection to pain point]
[Soft CTA]
```

**When to use:** Default framework for most cold outreach

---

## 3. Challenge of Similar Companies

Reference industry-specific pain and position as pattern you've seen.

**Structure:**
```
Companies doing [X revenue] in [industry] often struggle with [problem].

We've helped [similar companies] solve this by [solution].

Is this on your radar?
```

**When to use:** When targeting a specific vertical or company profile

## 4. Neutral Insight Framework

Share third-party resource (not your content) to build trust before pitching.

**Structure:**

Came across this [resource] that addresses [their problem].

Thought it might be useful given [observation about their situation].

[Optional soft pitch]
```
