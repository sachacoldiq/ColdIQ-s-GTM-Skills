# ColdIQ Messaging Templates

## 1. Ask Before Pitch (Will Allred)

```
Open-ended question → Trigger/observation → How product solves → PS relevance
```

**Example:**
```
How are you currently handling [challenge]?

Noticed [trigger/observation about their company].

We help companies like yours [solution].

PS - Relevant because [specific trigger]
```

---

## 2. Not Too Different Persona

```
"I work with [similar ICP], they struggle with [problem]..."
```

**Example:**
```
I work with B2B SaaS companies doing $2-5M ARR.

They usually struggle with pipeline predictability.

Is that something you're dealing with at {{company}}?
```

## 3. Upfront Value (Jordan Crawford)

```
"Here's [value offering], hope it was helpful..."
```

**Example:**
```
Here's a quick breakdown of your top 3 competitors' outbound strategies.

Hope it's useful.

If you want, I can share how we'd approach it differently for {{company}}.
```

## 4. Leverage Content in Outbound (Ethan Parker)

```
"We've compiled [content] on [how it helps]. Can I send it over?
PS - Relevant because [trigger]"
```

**Example:**
```
We've compiled a playbook on signal-based outbound for B2B SaaS.

Can I send it over?

PS - Relevant because I saw you're hiring SDRs.
```

## 5. "Why Are You Paying?" (Leif Bisping)

```
Set stage with life situation → Obvious choice → Compare to prospect's current solution
```

**Example:**
```
Imagine paying for a gym membership but only using the treadmill.

That's what most companies do with their CRM - pay for 100 features, use 10.

Why are you paying for {{competitor}} when you only need [core feature]?
```

---

## 6. Case Study Reference

```
Our client [Lead Solution] used to prospect [ICP].

They focused on:
[Problem 1], [Problem 2], [Problem 3].

Since you focus on {{summary}}, might work well if you combined [free resource].

Could I share the outbound campaign they were using to book 35 meetings/month?
```
