# Personalization Hooks to Relevance

## Strong Hook (Verbatim Tie)

Direct quote or reference from their content.

**Pattern:**
```
"In your recent [content type] about [topic], you mentioned [direct quote]..."
```

**Examples:**
```
In your recent post about SDR burnout, you mentioned "the biggest issue is lack of quality leads"...

In your podcast episode on scaling sales, you said "we struggled with pipeline predictability until..."

Your article on RevOps made a point about "data silos killing deal velocity"...
```

**When to use:**
- High-value prospects
- Enterprise accounts
- When you have strong content to reference

---

## Lite Hook (Conceptual Tie)

Reference the theme/topic without direct quote.

**Pattern:**
```
"I noticed you're focused on [theme/topic]..."
```

**Examples:**
```
I noticed you're focused on scaling your SDR team...

Saw you've been posting about RevOps challenges...

Looks like pipeline predictability is a priority for you...
```

**When to use:**
- Higher volume outreach
- When content isn't quotable
- Time-constrained personalization

## Hook Selection Framework

| Situation | Hook Type | Effort |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Enterprise $100K+ deal | Strong Hook | High |
| Mid-market $25-100K | Either | Medium |
| SMB/Volume play | Lite Hook | Low |
| Champion already exists | Lite Hook | Low |
| Competitive displacement | Strong Hook | High |

## Hook Integration Examples

**Strong Hook + Relevance:**
```
In your recent post about outbound being "broken," you mentioned cold emails getting <1% reply rates.

We've been helping teams like [similar company] hit 15%+ by focusing on signal-based targeting instead of volume.

Worth comparing notes?
```

**Lite Hook + Relevance:**
```
Noticed you're scaling the BDR team at {{company}}.

Most BDR leaders I talk to are dealing with ramp time and pipeline quality.

We helped [similar company] cut ramp by 40%.

Is that something you're working on?
```
