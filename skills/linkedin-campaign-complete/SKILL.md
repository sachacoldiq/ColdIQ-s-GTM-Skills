For message templates, see [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

## High-Converting LinkedIn Targets

### Tier 1 (Highest Priority)
- LinkedIn Webinar/Event attendees
- Post engagers (filter to ICP via Clay)
- Company page followers
- Profile viewers

### Tier 2 (Good Priority)
- Recently created group members
- Newsletter subscribers
- Content commenters

**Critical Filter:** "Posted within last 30 days" = Active user

## LinkedIn Copywriting Rules

1. Never over one paragraph long
2. 3-4 sentences maximum
3. Focus on creating conversation, not selling
4. Use eye-catching auto-embedding resources (Loom, posts, webinars)

## LinkedIn Campaign Sequence (Human-Like)

```
Step 1: View profile (Day 1)
         ↓
Step 2: Like a recent post (Day 1-2)
         ↓
Step 3: Send connection request (Day 2-3)
         ↓
[Wait for acceptance]
         ↓
Step 4: Send first message (4-24 hours after acceptance)
         ↓
Step 5: Follow-up if no response (Day 5-7)
```

## Scheduling Best Practices

| Timezone | Prospect's working hours (9 AM - 6 PM) |
| Days | Weekdays only (Mon-Thu best) |
| Breaks | At least one day off per week |
| Timing | When they're likely online |
