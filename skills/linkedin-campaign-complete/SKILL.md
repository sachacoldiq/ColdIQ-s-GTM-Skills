# LinkedIn Campaign Complete Guide

## High-Converting LinkedIn Targets

### Tier 1 (Highest Priority)
- LinkedIn Webinar/Event attendees
- Post engagers (filter to ICP via Clay)
- Company page followers
- Profile viewers

### Tier 2 (Good Priority)
- Recently created group members
- Newsletter subscribers
- Content commenters

### Sales Navigator Must-Use Filter
- **"Posted within last 30 days"** = Active user
- Critical to avoid wasting connection requests on inactive profiles

---

## LinkedIn Copywriting Rules

1. **Never over one paragraph long**
2. **3-4 sentences maximum**
3. **Focus on creating conversation, not selling**
4. **Use eye-catching auto-embedding resources:**
   - Loom videos
   - LinkedIn posts
   - Webinar links
   - Newsletter signups

## LinkedIn Campaign Sequence (Human-Like)

```
Step 1: View profile (Day 1)
         ↓
Step 2: Like a recent post (Day 1-2)
         ↓
Step 3: Send connection request (Day 2-3)
         ↓
[Wait for acceptance]
         ↓
Step 4: Send first message (4-24 hours after acceptance)
         ↓
Step 5: Follow-up if no response (Day 5-7)
```

### Scheduling Best Practices
- **Timezone:** Within prospect's working hours (9 AM - 6 PM their time)
- **Days:** Weekdays only (Mon-Thu best, Fri lower engagement)
- **Breaks:** At least one day off per week
- **Timing:** Message when they're likely online (inbox visibility)

## LinkedIn Message Templates

### Profile Viewer Follow-Up
```
Hey {{first_name}}, noticed you checked out my profile.

What caught your attention?
```
**Reply rate:** 28-35% (vs 8-12% cold)

### Connection Acceptance Message
```
Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}.

Quick q — what's your biggest challenge with {{relevant_topic}} right now?
```

### Post Engager Follow-Up
```
Hey {{first_name}}, saw you liked my post about {{topic}}.

Is {{pain_point}} something you're dealing with at {{company}}?
```

### Warm Intro Request
```
Hey {{first_name}}, noticed we both know {{mutual_connection}}.

I've been working with {{similar_company}} on {{topic}}.

Would you be open to a quick chat?
```

### Event Attendee Follow-Up
```
Hey {{first_name}}, saw you attended {{event_name}}.

What was your biggest takeaway?

I've been thinking about {{related_topic}} — curious if that resonated.
```

## Connection Request Notes

### With Note (Higher acceptance, limited characters)
```
Hey {{first_name}} — saw your work on {{topic}}. Would love to connect.
```

### Without Note (Higher volume, slightly lower acceptance)
- Use for Tier 2 targets
- Compensate with strong first message
