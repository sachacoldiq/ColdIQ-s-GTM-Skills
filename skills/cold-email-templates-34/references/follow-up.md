## Follow-Up Best Practices

| Timing | Email # | Subject | Key Change |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Day 3-5 | Email 2 | Same thread | New angle, shorter |
| Day 7-10 | Email 3 | Same thread | Different CTA |
| Day 14+ | Email 4 | New subject | Fresh approach |

**Rules:**
- Each follow-up shorter than previous
- Add new information, don't just "bump"
- Different CTA style each time
- No guilt or pressure
