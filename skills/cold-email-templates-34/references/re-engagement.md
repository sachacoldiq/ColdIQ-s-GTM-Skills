## #31 No-Oriented Question (Rebooking Demos)
```
Subject: quick question

{{firstName}},

Would it be crazy to reconnect?

I know we talked {{timeframe}} ago about {{topic}}.

{{New_information}} has changed since then.

Still relevant?
```

**Why it works:** "Would it be crazy" invites "no" response, which is easier psychologically than committing to "yes"

## #32 Reactivating Closed Lost
```
Subject: since we last talked

{{firstName}},

When we talked in {{month}}, you mentioned {{objection}}.

Since then, we've {{improvement}}.

Worth another look?
```

**Best timing:** 3-6 months after closed lost

## #33 Ghosted Prospect Recovery
```
Subject: checking in

{{firstName}},

We were chatting about {{topic}} back in {{month}}.

Things went quiet on your end (totally get it—priorities shift).

Is this still on your radar, or should I close the loop?
```

**Why it works:** Offers easy exit, reduces pressure

## #34 Renewal/Upsell Trigger
```
Subject: {{upcoming_date}}

{{firstName}},

Noticed your {{contract/subscription}} is coming up in {{timeframe}}.

Before you renew, worth discussing {{improvement/expansion}}?

Most companies at your stage are adding {{feature/service}}.

Quick call this week?
```

## Re-Engagement Timing Guide

| Scenario | Wait Time | Best Approach |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Ghosted mid-conversation | 2-3 weeks | #33 Ghosted Recovery |
| Closed lost | 3-6 months | #32 Reactivating |
| Old demo, no close | 2-4 months | #31 No-Oriented |
| Renewal coming | 30-60 days before | #34 Renewal Trigger |

**Key Principle:** Always add new information or a reason to reconnect—never just "checking in" without value.
