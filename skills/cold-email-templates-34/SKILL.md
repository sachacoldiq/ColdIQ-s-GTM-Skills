## Template Categories

## Key Template Principles

1. **Lead with pain not features**
2. **Keep qualification simple** (deeper on calls)
3. **Personalize to person not just company**
4. **Use specific social proof numbers** ("47% increase" not "significant improvement")
5. **Soft CTAs work better** ("worth a look?" vs "book a call")
6. **Multi-channel coordination** (email + LinkedIn + ads)
7. **Humor reduces tension**
8. **Timing matters** (new role signals peak at days 14-45)
9. **Value-first before asking**
