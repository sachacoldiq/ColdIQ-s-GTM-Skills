# Cold Call Objection Responses

## "Not interested"

```
"Totally fair. Mind if I ask—is it the timing, or is [problem] just not a priority right now?"
```

**Why it works:** Uncovers real objection (timing vs relevance)

---

## "Send me an email"

```
"Happy to. Quick question so I can make it relevant—what's your biggest challenge with [topic] right now?"
```

**Why it works:** Turns brush-off into qualification opportunity

---

## "We already have a solution"

```
"Got it. How's that working for you? Most companies I talk to are still seeing [common problem] even with [solution type]."
```

**Why it works:** Opens door to discuss gaps in current solution

---

## "No budget"

```
"Understood. Out of curiosity—if budget weren't a constraint, would [problem] be worth solving?"
```

**Why it works:** Separates budget timing from problem priority

---

## "I'm too busy right now"

```
"Totally get it. When would be a better time to have a 10-minute conversation about this?"
```

**Why it works:** Accepts the timing, asks for future commitment

---

## "We're not looking to change"

```
"Makes sense. Just curious—what would need to change for you to consider alternatives?"
```

**Why it works:** Plants seed for future, uncovers switching triggers

---

## "Can you call back later?"

```
"Sure. What's a good day and time? I'll put it in my calendar now."
```

**Why it works:** Gets specific commitment vs vague brush-off

---

## "How did you get my number?"

```
"Totally fair question. Your company came up in our research as a good fit for what we do. I can send you more context via email if that's easier?"
```

**Why it works:** Honest, offers alternative channel

## Objection Handling Principles

1. **Never argue** - Acknowledge their point first
2. **Ask questions** - Turn objections into conversations
3. **Stay curious** - Genuine interest > scripted responses
4. **Know when to stop** - "No" three times = move on
5. **Leave door open** - Every call builds familiarity
