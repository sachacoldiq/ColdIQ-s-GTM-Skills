# Cold Call Scripts

## 1-Minute Cold Call Script (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Pattern Interrupt Opening
```
"Hey {{firstName}}, this is [Name] from ColdIQ—
I know I'm catching you out of the blue."
```

**Why it works:** Acknowledges the interruption, reduces defensiveness

---

### Step 2: Permission-Based Transition
```
"Mind if I take 30 seconds to tell you why I called?
Then you can decide if it's worth continuing."
```

**Why it works:** Gives them control, earns right to pitch

---

### Step 3: Problem Statement
```
"I work with [ICP] who are struggling with [problem]."
```

**Why it works:** Establishes relevance quickly

---

### Step 4: Social Proof
```
"We just helped [similar company] achieve [result]."
```

**Why it works:** Credibility through specific example

---

### Step 5: CTA
```
"Is that something you're dealing with right now?"
```

**Why it works:** Opens conversation vs asking for meeting

---

## Full Script Example

```
"Hey Sarah, this is Mike from ColdIQ—I know I'm catching you out of the blue.

Mind if I take 30 seconds to tell you why I called? Then you can decide if it's worth continuing.

I work with B2B SaaS companies doing $5-20M who are struggling with inconsistent pipeline.

We just helped a company similar to yours book 40+ qualified meetings per month.

Is pipeline predictability something you're dealing with right now?"
```

---

## No-Show Phone Script

```
"Hey {{firstName}}, it's [Name] from ColdIQ.

We had a call scheduled for [time]—
wanted to make sure everything's okay.

No worries if something came up.
Would [alternative time] work better?"
```

**Key principles:**
- No guilt or pressure
- Assume good intent
- Offer easy reschedule
- Keep it brief

---

## Voicemail Script

```
"Hey {{firstName}}, [Name] from ColdIQ.

Quick message—I work with [ICP] on [problem].

Thought it might be relevant given [trigger/observation].

I'll shoot you an email with some times.

Talk soon."
```

**Length:** Under 20 seconds

## Objection Responses

### "Not interested"
```
"Totally fair. Mind if I ask—is it the timing, or is [problem] just not a priority right now?"
```

### "Send me an email"
```
"Happy to. Quick question so I can make it relevant—what's your biggest challenge with [topic] right now?"
```

### "We already have a solution"
```
"Got it. How's that working for you? Most companies I talk to are still seeing [common problem] even with [solution type]."
```

### "No budget"
```
"Understood. Out of curiosity—if budget weren't a constraint, would [problem] be worth solving?"
```
