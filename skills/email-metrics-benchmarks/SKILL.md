# Email Metrics & Benchmarks

## Email Metrics to Track

### 2X Levers (Metrics you can realistically double)

| Metric | Current Baseline | Good | Great |
|--------|------------------|------|-------|
| Cold email reply rate | 0.5-1.0% | 2-3% | 5%+ |
| Email open rate | 20-40% | 50% | 60%+ |
| Email click rate | 2-5% | 5-8% | 10%+ |

---

## Performance by Outreach Type

| Outreach Type | Reply Rate |
|---------------|------------|
| Cold outreach (no signal) | 6-8% |
| Signal-based outreach | 18-22% |
| Multi-signal stacked | 35-40% |
| Website visitor follow-up | 25-30% |
| Champion job change | 20-25% |

---

## Email Structure Checklist

```
Opening (trigger) + Assumption + Social proof with numbers + Open-ended question
```

### By Seniority

| Target | Max Sentences | Max Words |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| BTL (Managers, ICs) | 3-4 sentences | 90 words |
| ATL (VPs, C-Level) | 2-3 sentences | 60 words |

---

## Deliverability Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| Bounce rate | <2% | 2-5% | >5% |
| Spam rate | <0.1% | 0.1-0.3% | >0.3% |
| Unsubscribe rate | <0.5% | 0.5-1% | >1% |

---

## Sequence Performance

### Email 1
- Highest open rate
- Sets the tone
- Most important to optimize

### Email 2 (Day 3)
- 40-60% of Email 1 opens
- Different angle
- Shorter than Email 1

### Email 3 (Day 14)
- New subject line
- Fresh approach
- Delegation ask effective

### Email 4 (Break-up)
- Often highest reply rate
- Creates urgency
- Clean exit

---

## Optimization Priorities

### If Open Rate Low (<30%)
1. Test subject lines
2. Check sender reputation
3. Verify deliverability
4. Test send times

### If Reply Rate Low (<2%)
1. Improve relevance/personalization
2. Shorten message
3. Strengthen CTA
4. Add social proof
5. Test different frameworks

### If Meeting Rate Low (<20% of replies)
1. Qualify better in message
2. Improve CTA clarity
3. Reduce friction to book
4. Follow up faster

## Quick Diagnostics

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Low opens | Subject line or deliverability | A/B test subjects, check spam score |
| Opens but no replies | Message relevance | More personalization, shorter copy |
| Replies but no meetings | Weak CTA or poor qualification | Clearer ask, better targeting |
| High unsubscribe | Too aggressive or wrong ICP | Reduce frequency, refine targeting |
