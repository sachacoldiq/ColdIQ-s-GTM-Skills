# 11 GTM Plays (Detailed Execution)

## Play 1: New Team Members

**Signal:** Company recently added team members in relevant department

**Execution:**
- Reference the new hire's {{name}} in copy
- Shows you're paying attention to their growth
- Works best 2-4 weeks after hire announcement

**Template:**
```
Noticed {{company}} just added {{new_hire_name}} to the {{department}} team.

Growing teams usually means [relevant challenge].

We helped {{similar_company}} handle this by [solution].

Worth a quick chat?
```

---

## Play 2: Skills-Targeting

**Signal:** LinkedIn profile displays specific skills relevant to your product

**Execution:**
- Target based on listed skills (not just job titles)
- More precise than title-based targeting
- Clay can extract skills from LinkedIn profiles

**Use Cases:**
- Salesforce skill → Salesforce add-on products
- Python skill → Developer tools
- HubSpot skill → Marketing automation

---

## Play 3: Role-Targeting

**Signal:** Uncommon job title indicates company priority

**Execution:**
- Target very specific, unusual titles
- Title existence = company budget/priority

**Examples:**
- "Happiness Manager" → Employee wellbeing budget exists
- "E-commerce Specialist" → Confirmed e-commerce operation
- "RevOps Manager" → Revenue operations is a priority
- "Growth Engineer" → Technical growth function exists

---

## Play 4: Industry-Level Research

**Signal:** Create your own signal through surveys

**Execution:**
1. Survey ICP experts on topics they care about
2. Opens conversations with value-first approach
3. Use insights as content later

**Template:**
```
Hey {{first_name}} — we're surveying {{role}} experts on {{topic}}.

We have a page listing {{insight_type}} used at {{company_types}}.

Want to contribute?
[Link]

You can add your links too (socials, projects, blog, website).
We get ~XXk monthly visits so it's good exposure.
```

---

## Play 5: Resources for Individual Contributors (Evergreen)

**Signal:** New SDRs/ICs starting roles continuously

**Execution:**
- Automated, always-on campaign
- Send useful resource when someone starts a new IC role
- Long-term brand building

**Template:**
```
Hey {{first_name}}, congrats on the new role at {{company_name}}.

We know how tough outreach can be, so we compiled our highest-converting cold email frameworks (used by 364 SDRs already!).

Here they are: [Link]

Good luck!
```

---

## Play 6: Leaving Employees

**Signal:** Team members recently left (relevant department)

**Execution:**
- Reference the departing person's {{name}}
- Position around coverage gap
- Timing: 1-2 weeks after departure

**Template:**
```
Saw {{former_employee}} recently left {{company}}.

That usually creates a gap in {{function_area}}.

We've been helping companies like {{similar_company}} cover that gap with [solution].

Worth exploring?
```

---

## Play 7: Companies Without Dedicated Employees

**Signal:** No one with specific title at company

**Execution:**
- Identify companies missing a key role
- Position your product as the solution
- Works well for automation/outsourcing products

**Example Logic:**
- No "Content Manager" + $5M+ revenue = Content gap
- No "DevOps Engineer" + Growing engineering team = DevOps need
- No "SDR Manager" + SDR team exists = Management gap

---

## Play 8: Bad Reviews Targeting

**Signal:** Negative G2/Capterra review of competitor

**Execution:**
- Scrape negative reviews (identifiable reviewers)
- Reference their specific pain
- Offer alternatives

**Template:**
```
Just saw your review of {{competitor}}...

We researched and tested 3 alternatives (that don't suck).

Shall I send the report to you?

Cheers,
[Name]
```

## Play 9: AI-Generated Ideas

**Signal:** Create personalized value through AI research

**Execution:**
1. Use AI to generate 2 relevant ideas for their business
2. Add your offer as the 3rd (with humor)
3. Offer more ideas with context

**Template:**
```
Based on {{company_description}}, here are 3 ideas:

[1] {{AI_generated_idea_1}}
[2] {{AI_generated_idea_2}}
[3] Hire a sales prospecting agency (like ColdIQ) to start generating leads on autopilot

I'd probably give better ideas with more context.

Want to chat?
```

## Play 10: ServiceBell Allbound Plays

**Signal:** Website visitor activity

**Execution:**
- Coordinate outbound with real-time website visits
- Call/email when prospect is on site
- Multi-touch engagement strategy

**Sequence:**

**Execution:**
