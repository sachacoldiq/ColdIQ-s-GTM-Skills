## Play Details

Target LinkedIn skills (not just titles). Clay extracts skills from profiles.

Uncommon titles signal budget/priority.

### 5. Resources for ICs (Evergreen)
Automated campaign sending resources to new ICs. Long-term brand building.

### 7. No Dedicated Role
No "Content Manager" + $5M+ revenue = content gap opportunity.

### 8. Bad Reviews Targeting
Scrape negative reviews, reference their pain, offer alternatives.

### 9. AI-Generated Ideas
Generate 2 relevant ideas + your offer as #3 (with humor).

### 10. ServiceBell Allbound
