# GTM Plays Templates

## Play 1: New Team Members

```
Noticed {{company}} just added {{new_hire_name}} to the {{department}} team.

Growing teams usually means [relevant challenge].

We helped {{similar_company}} handle this by [solution].

Worth a quick chat?
```

## Play 4: Industry-Level Research

```
Hey {{first_name}} — we're surveying {{role}} experts on {{topic}}.

We have a page listing {{insight_type}} used at {{company_types}}.

Want to contribute?

You can add your links too (socials, projects, blog, website).
We get ~XXk monthly visits so it's good exposure.
```

## Play 5: Resources for ICs

```
Hey {{first_name}}, congrats on the new role at {{company_name}}.

We know how tough outreach can be, so we compiled our highest-converting cold email frameworks (used by 364 SDRs already!).

Here they are: [Link]

Good luck!
```

## Play 6: Leaving Employees

```
Saw {{former_employee}} recently left {{company}}.

That usually creates a gap in {{function_area}}.

We've been helping companies like {{similar_company}} cover that gap with [solution].

Worth exploring?
```

## Play 8: Bad Reviews Targeting

```
Just saw your review of {{competitor}}...

We researched and tested 3 alternatives (that don't suck).

Shall I send the report to you?

Cheers,

```

## Play 9: AI-Generated Ideas

```
Based on {{company_description}}, here are 3 ideas:

[1] {{AI_generated_idea_1}}
[2] {{AI_generated_idea_2}}
[3] Hire a sales prospecting agency (like ColdIQ) to start generating leads on autopilot

I'd probably give better ideas with more context.

Want to chat?

## Play 11: Inbound Followers

```
Hey {{first_name}}, thanks for the follow.

Noticed you're a {{title}} at {{company}}.

Most {{title}}s I talk to are dealing with {{common_problem}}.

Is that on your radar?
