## LinkedIn Warm-Up Protocol

### When Needed
- Inactive accounts
- New accounts
- Accounts returning from restriction

### Process

**Days 1-10:**
- 60 interactions/day maximum
- Only manual activity (no automation)
- Mix of views, likes, comments
- Focus on genuine engagement

**Days 11-20:**
- Gradually increase to 80/day
- Start light connection requests (5-10/day)
- Continue manual engagement

**Days 21+:**
- Gradual increase to full limits
- Introduce automation carefully
- Monitor for warnings

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

1. **Sudden activity spikes** - Gradual increase only
2. **Same message to everyone** - Vary your copy
3. **Connecting outside work hours** - Stay within 9 AM - 6 PM
4. **Weekend activity** - Weekdays only
5. **Automation too early** - Manual first 2-3 weeks

## Account Health Indicators

| Indicator | Healthy | Warning | Danger |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Connection acceptance | >30% | 15-30% | <15% |
| Message response | >10% | 5-10% | <5% |
| Profile views | Stable | Declining | Blocked |
| Pending connections | <500 | 500-700 | >700 |

---

## Recovery from Restriction

1. Stop all automation immediately
2. Manual activity only for 2 weeks
3. Respond to existing conversations
4. Post valuable content
5. Engage with others' content
6. Slowly reintroduce outreach
