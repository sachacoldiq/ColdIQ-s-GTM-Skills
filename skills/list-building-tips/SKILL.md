# List Building Pro Tips

## Core Principles

### 1. Mix Sources
- Don't rely on just one data provider
- Each source has different strengths/coverage
- Combine for maximum coverage

### 2. Scraping = Step 1
- Raw scraped data is just the beginning
- Still need Clay enrichment for:
  - Email verification
  - Phone numbers
  - Company data
  - Custom signals

### 3. Templates Are Modular
- Start with proven templates
- Adjust for specific campaign goals
- Don't rebuild from scratch

### 4. Don't Reinvent the Wheel
- Use existing Clay templates
- Modify rather than create
- Learn from what works
