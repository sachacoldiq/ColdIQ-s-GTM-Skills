# Cold Email 4-Sequence Framework

Standard 4-email sequence framework for cold outreach.

## Email 1 - Trigger-Based Opening

- Observation about their situation + one-line case study
- Soft CTA (question-based)
- Length: 3-4 sentences BTL, 2-3 sentences ATL

## Email 2 - Pain/Main KPI Focus

- Address primary pain point
- Connect to key metric they care about

## Email 3 - Someone Else's Responsibilities

- Delegation ask ("who handles X?")
- Opens thread to correct person

## Email 4 - Break-Up

- Timing question ("Is this not a priority right now?")
- Clean exit that leaves door open

## Email Structure Checklist

```
Opening (trigger) + Assumption + Social proof with numbers + Open-ended question
```

- **BTL emails:** 3-4 sentences
- **ATL emails:** 2-3 sentences

## Timing

- Email 2: Send 3 days after Email 1
- Email 3: Send 14 days later (new subject line)
- Email 4: Break-up if no response
