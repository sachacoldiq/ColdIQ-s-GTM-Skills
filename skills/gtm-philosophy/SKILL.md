# Core GTM Philosophy

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Scale what top performers do** - Study best reps, systematize their approach

2. **Diagnose before prescribing** - BIPSY framework: Behaviors, Individual, Process, Skill, You

3. **Signal-based outreach = 3-4x higher contract values**

4. **You can't burn your TAM** - Re-engage with new angles

5. **Lead with pain, not features** - HockeyStack approach: "Do you have problems tying brand awareness to revenue?"

6. **Segment and convert, don't over-personalize** - Gorgias went from 200 sequences to 10 modular ones

## Multi-Channel Coordination

**The Data:**
- Email + ads + referrals = extra $2M ARR (case study)
- ABM approach = 36% meeting rate vs 10% non-ABM
- Warm before you touch principle

**Coordination Strategy:**

| Channel | Role | Timing |
|---------|------|--------|
| Ads | Warm up, build awareness | Before outreach |
| Email | Primary outreach | Day 1 |
| LinkedIn | Secondary touch | Day 2-3 |
| Phone | High-intent follow-up | After engagement |
| Referrals | Leverage network | Throughout |

## Key Mindsets

### On Personalization
- Personalize to the person, not just the company
- Use specific numbers, not vague claims
- Research should inform approach, not just first line

### On Volume vs Quality
- Quality signals beat high volume
- 100 signal-based emails > 1000 cold emails
- Stack signals for heat scoring (3+ signals = reach out same day)

### On Timing
- New role signals peak at days 14-45
- Website visitors: act within 24-48 hours
- Funding announcements: wait 2-4 weeks

### On Messaging
- Lead with pain, not features
- Soft CTAs outperform hard asks
- Humor reduces tension and increases response
